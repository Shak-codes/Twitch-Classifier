biglij_: Why you on five today dyl
hinata8008: high key I wanna see dyl heal too
KingXFactor20: This prolly all they play tonight right? didn't catch the intro
hinata8008: Ben ended up on 4 before dyl switched
hinata8008: dylllll
hinata8008: sponsor
we_were_okkara: Dyl needs to stay DPS and tell Ip to go Loki which would literally make both of them better
biglij_: @hinata8008 appreciate it
thehmmmm: yeah that's definitely a smurfing wolverine. I've seen wolvs in my celestial games worse than that
CGrizzley: gg
hinata8008: danggggg it Dylan
wrektangles: dyl you got a bad habit of holding your ults
redpanda_cc: that was a warm up, it dont count
hinata8008: language Cap
Alistiel: your dps need to destroy the lamps
Omar_The_Loon: need ant dive
CGrizzley: what did you guys learn
naeemZMP: @thehmmmm stop the cap
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: you can stun him with e
KingXFactor20: ya'll need to warm up on quick play instead of comp
Riio888: PLAY THOR DYL
kapitalsteez08: dyl Bucky counters wolverine
makfxt: dyl u had nice angle on wolv w hela u coulda got headshots but u just werent shooting him
zachary904: should been trying to kill that wolverine
hinata8008: that's first game
aragonndakaj: yo
we_were_okkara: Tell Ippi to go Loki. It’s the literal team up bro. like what are we doing?
ijetst3ri: please get Ipi off Scarlett 😂😂😂😂
ICanDropWolverine: You need a range dps. scarlet is only close to mid range
nillasaur: Whats good Dylan
wrektangles: nah you good on hela
Riio888: stop ipi
TrinaLanay: lock in yall, predicts up in main
alzorzu: Dyl you kinda goated
rickbtw: DYL TELL IPPI TO TRY MR FANTASTIC
Riio888: DYL
Riio888: LANGUAGE
KingXFactor20: oh so it is sponsored lol
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: yall need to communicate more effectively
Omar_The_Loon: someone should try peni
makfxt: dyl imo ur better on psylocke
ijetst3ri: yeah MR fantastic might be nice for Ip
elkevino2021: dylan wouldnt it be better for you to use psylocke for the emma teamup clone
redpanda_cc: are drops enabled
CGrizzley: completely leave when they dump ults. if you live and give up the point for 5 seconds you can just get it back instead of dieing and returning in 15 - 20 seconds
saint_fuego: My bad dyl i wasn't locked in on the stream you'll win next match for sure
biglij_: Wait it's a sponsored stream
thehmmmm: the real wolv counter on your team is emma. mark should be chokeslamming him on cd
erictrump1: Go bucky
nillasaur: Yo Dylan no cap you should read boruto
johnjudkins11: Bucky is good anti dive dyl
kapitalsteez08: no just stun him
makfxt: if ur on psy u can try flank the healers and dps then when they turn around to deal w u it gives the rest of ur team a chsnce o push up
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: also back up when they start luring
thehmmmm: and lee can invis woman pull wolverine mid-air and cancel her grab
elkevino2021: the emma/psylocke clones are very good for taking out healers quickly
Riio888: that’s your job as a dps
Riio888: and healers
kapitalsteez08: get emma on wolverine or go Bucky for the grab
makfxt: ur job as someone on psy is to just be annoying and getting off angles
elkevino2021: because you can insta kill healers with that psylocke clone
Ron_2C: hela might be ur best hero rn dyl
we_were_okkara: PUT IPPI ON LOKI AND STOP BSING
CGrizzley: tanks need to live. they are the ones who take space
makfxt: hela is same about getting off angles and aim for getting headshots
redpanda_cc: this is a good map for hela, lots of off angles
kayiiah: its everyones job... if u getting beamed by a squid jus kill it lol
yeMofo: @kayiiah not everyone can reach or shoot it
moneymatt824: tanks job is not supposed to be the lamps and the squids it’s yours
SawDeens: diff the Hela I believe
hinata8008: invisible woman's thing is good for squids tho with little to no effort fr
makfxt: dyl tanks cant really deal w loki and squids as muchh as dps can tbh its a dps job mainy to deal w them
hazyperceptionz: dps can reach easier and these tanks will tunnel on them and not create no space focusing on some squids
thehmmmm: ngl thor should never kill a starlord like that
EnnAkio: you know dyl locekd in when hes mouth just open
LordLassy: someone on yall team should honestly learn loki bro
hinata8008: Dylan did try Loki before
LordLassy: he’s the best anti dive healer
Omar_The_Loon: yall dont have any crowd control, only single target damage, so dive is gonna be hard to deal with
LordLassy: oh really?
hinata8008: he just needed to get used to being a healer too
mistermyst3505: hela diff
don_only_: I love it when y’all play marvels gang
LordLassy: damn, Loki is deadass a anti dive shutdown
hinata8008: yeah I thought he was doing good, chat hated the ults he would steal
Ron_2C: @hinata8008 for the sake of the team Dyl gotta be dps 😂
LordLassy: and that’s what they suffer from
roti28: Psylocke
erictrump1: Go bucky
makfxt: u supposed to fly away get better angle u turned ur back on where they were all pushing form
Christ_Dilorean: sibling abuse
elkevino2021: @LordLassy yeah they have to be locked in on destroying the loki lamps
TjtheHero: tell j go diamond form more
hinata8008: LMAO he can be dps Loki too @ @ron_2c

erictrump1: go bucky
elijah92594: Dyl you got to play a tank buster
elkevino2021: @likemymindz black panther?
johnjudkins11: Bucky is good anti dive
redpanda_cc: @likemymindz bp is hard to learn, i would say magik
wrektangles: I swear after the very first push of the game they just keep staggering until they lose the game
dzeery31: gg
roti28: u need to dive
elijah92594: Play iron fist or wolverine
thehmmmm: don't need to swap to kill thor. hela kills thor just fine
likemymindz: use bp or magik
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: lowkey moon knight
makfxt: dyl when u keep dying taking them ones u kinda hoe ur team cuz they will lose the team fight

Omar_The_Loon: just protect ur supports
Jordan22123315: GO THING MARK
roti28: psylocke has a team up with emma
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: you got it gang
TheLightningEagle: and having a escape plan, since hela doesnt move well

erictrump1: switch
likemymindz: please one of yall learn how to dive with psy bp or magik
thehmmmm: they're playing 5v6 and chat giving him hero suggestions.
Dramoc: Dyl knows Psy

hinata8008: yall eatingggg
we_were_okkara: @thehmmmm He doesn’t get value ults now. all he would need to do is steal Lee’s ult lmfao
jajajakosha: tanks pushing obj is the best move frl
hinata8008: keep it up
likemymindz: that team sorry
thehmmmm: dyl didn't listen to a single suggestion from chat about switching characters and he's winning. says a lot imo
hinata8008: W comms fr
mistermyst3505: get a hela skin
makfxt: nah yall going crazy fr
TrinaLanay: WWWWWWW
TheLightningEagle: @we_were_okkara he literally just did
we_were_okkara: How hard can it be for Mark and Ben to say “Ippi steal a heal ult now!”
hinata8008: @thehmmmm no dead ass
TheLightningEagle: and im critical on Ippi
Darionna: WWWW
bishertgab: @thehmmmm hela was a good pick no one gonna say to swap unless they started losing
SawDeens: fr, ippi just needs to counter ult with his ult
TheLightningEagle: HE LITERALLY got 2 important kills
TheLightningEagle: @we_were_okkara this is helpful
TheLightningEagle: isnt
hinata8008: Mark W IGL
mistermyst3505: helas best skin is the og one.
we_were_okkara: @thelightningeagle That was bad timing. My main point is that I’m not worried about his ult’s with Loki
TheLightningEagle: now the only thing right now is does dyl have a escape plan
hinata8008: lmao she mad
TheLightningEagle: thats a tough position to hold
we_were_okkara: the last time Ip used Loki Mark was playing Hawkeye and punisher
SawDeens: definitely lockdown magik
TheLightningEagle: @we_were_okkara well right now they arent sooooo
AkiiFPSS: play behind the corner
likemymindz: if thats a good magik focus her
AkiiFPSS: play behind the corner more often dylan
TheLightningEagle: this is a better position
we_were_okkara: and Ippi has been using SW ever since ñ
bishertgab: @we_were_okkara ipi cant aim bro he not playing Loki
SawDeens: enemy too sorry, dylan can play in the open
TheLightningEagle: easier to hold
kuttersupreme: what games have they played already
SawDeens: lol psylocke
Bentfreezy: Only rivals so far
kuttersupreme: okay thank you
redpanda_cc: this is the same team as last game, most likely a 5 or 6 stack
TheLightningEagle: now  now ult time
we_were_okkara: @bishertgab He literally doesn’t have to aim… Loki heals and does damage based off of splash. he just needs to hit their feet.
we_were_okkara: which also means that he can essentially grenade heal groups of people just by shooting the ground
bishertgab: @we_were_okkara he doesnt have the game sense for it bro either
hinata8008: niceeeee
we_were_okkara: but I get it. I’m yapping too much about it. I’ll stop
sammybiebie: NICE

goruto_hatake: 🥲 this is so beautiful to watch yall niggas cooking

Kronicdragon1: namor squids is a counter to magik
