KingiKirby: That‚Äôs how niggas at the movies use to be. ‚ÄúAye just give me 20 for the 8 of y‚Äôall‚Äù
jajajakosha: @2chill2furious wait you cant just hit her? damn
my_name_is_jaden: @tristansafonov he actually 30.
thegideon2410: Ipi gets killed alot from overextending and lacking team positioning awareness, he needs to be a backline DPS support, so namor, punisher (perfect bc of rocket teammup), Squirrel Girl, Scarlet witch(but imo if Strange is there)
nekoturalive: @jajajakosha he tried twice last round and failed miserably. needs get used to thats all
nekoturalive: @thegideon2410 that team ability i believe is gone next friday on the update so thats not a good recommendation

nekoturalive: @thegideon2410 these team needs to get used to the new update ASAP. they finna struggle some bad like BAD
thegideon2410: my point is still valid, how many times has ipi overextend with Wanda lol. If he focus's on backline protection while staying in their LOS, bc he was cooking when he switched to the punisher
nekoturalive: yeah ippi idk man he dont got pov so i cant see what hes up to all the time
k4w4n_h: Chat who is the best on rivals in RDC??
thegideon2410: @nekoturalive he clutched up with Wanda ult on loki map
thegideon2410: That Thing and Hulk comp was just doing whatever they want, im thinking to myself, "use Punisher with rocket teammate and melt those tanks with shotgun"
thegideon2410: How did Des get Lord Mag, I thought he just switched to him?
nekoturalive: their healers always get destroyed in the backline most of the time why they lose

billiecalvinn: as a thor main (30hours) it‚Äôs lowkey a buff
thegideon2410: @just_aleka I don't think its going to be that bad bc of the hammer throw change
billiecalvinn: keep that on the low tho
billiecalvinn: we gotta gatekeep
BlvckMidas: @thegideon2410 you are right tbh but the rocket punisher teamup is getting removed
thegideon2410: he'll get awakening faster using that hammer throw gaining more thorforce faster
BlvckMidas: ipi should be playing a third supp or backline dps, he doesnt value his life enough to play frontline or dive
