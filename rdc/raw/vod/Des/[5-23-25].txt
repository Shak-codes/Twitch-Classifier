Whyisallusernametaken: Dreamcon rivals match gonna be funny af
BlvckMidas: if you kept pressuring that cloak you might’ve killed her before she ulted
Jefehuddy: yea killing cloak wouldve won the game
nutmare210: Ippi focused on strange for some reason when he ulted
BlvckMidas: she sat inside lee’s ult too it would’ve been perfect
Jefehuddy: it was just you des fr
BlvckMidas: no they werent it was just you
N7_Nobukai: ohh the rocket combo

BlvckMidas: damn lee got ult dumb quick
N7_Nobukai: They jumpin yall healers
nimbustoofaraway: thor a smurf

Dont_KO: IPPI could go Mr fantastic tbh
Dont_KO: he's like a third tank
BruhWM: nah ben played good only 6 death
Dont_KO: his ult good too
SnakesRDY: you could always have an iron man play at ground level right next to the healers and just use the laser, thats what I do usually
NotCoose: get back on duck game atp
BlvckMidas: ipi should be rocket on defense and they run 3 supps
yaboijagerlive: yall not doin enough damage
eguzman54: des use ur shield to push up more with your team it’s blocks a lot
eguzman54: also put ur bubbles more on the healers
N7_Nobukai: @BruhWM yeah he was on point
Cloud2iArt: Do your thing Des, I'd just advise... If ippi plays Scarlet, Des should be Strange for a better team performance [Team up that kills tanks with Scarlet, and better Des Ults]. Otherwise, he needs to change to a more valuable DPS (maybe Squirrel Girl)
LouieTiw_: i think you guys need to utilize Team Ups
nimbustoofaraway: ippi switching now is dumb af
lewiqis_: des aim at the feet
eguzman54: shield right there
bishertgab: this gon be a tough game someone needs to dive the Hawkeye
bishertgab: An uncontested Hawkeye is gg

BlvckMidas: oh they using res comp
SnakesRDY: adam warlock can revive someone without his ult too
BlvckMidas: mantis and warlock
eguzman54: Des also when Mark charging in with thing bubble him
Cloud2iArt: Des stay on strange, and help out the team with a more reliable shield and boost Ippi
pharaoh_24: When y’all fight tanks yall feed healers
Lay_Somewhere66: You soo calm big bro
elijahkyo: you guys should go against the Ai mode and see if you win against them
Swift4: where did this "big bro" shtick come from?
SistahSoldier: gg
yaboijagerlive: QUICK PLAY BRO TRUST
maerceci09: Des, tell them to let Lee play Spiderman and Ipi heal, and see how that works...
Cloud2iArt: You guys should really try the Strange Scarlet team up fr fr
mikeoxblack123: des ask for a trade
Lay_Somewhere66: @maerceci09 too close to Dreamcon, they probably won't switch
maerceci09: @lay_somewhere66 It's really how they should have been playing cause Lee stayed off good af with SM...
micro_mini: TRY HULK
nimbustoofaraway: DAMN

TamiLoree: What up Des?
eguzman54: Des bubble Mark if he the thing
eguzman54: just keep eye when he’s rushing in
bishertgab: Des he’s playing Torch
Cloud2iArt: Thank you des, if his using controller he needs to hold both triggers while in it
pringle_fahad: dr strange has a damage nerf so he isnt as effective and ur team needs more damage cuz ippi isnt putting work
maerceci09: See, if Lee was playing SM, this would be a great stage for him...
SnakesRDY: @maerceci09 SM is probably the hardest character in the game lol
BlvckMidas: bro said spidey lol chill
FlareWarrior101: des u had ult with strange my brother
pringle_fahad: @SnakesRDY i think hes talking about bronze is easy to get picks with spidey
pringle_fahad: its better to train him now in bronze rather later lol ig
yaboijagerlive: ...
pringle_fahad: nonethless spiderman is not what they need lol
SnakesRDY: watching this makes me want to hop on rivals
pringle_fahad: des remeber u have ur teamup with emma

deddzombie: des use your teamup and e more often
BlvckMidas: get on the cart
BlvckMidas: damn almost
Guccivalachi: Des for your ult you need to let the ball cooldown go all the way then throw it at the very end for max damage it can kill cloak and dagger  mid ult
pringle_fahad: teamup is F
dbrazierr: u doing good!
Downbeat110: des you should change your settings so you can see your teams hp
Lay_Somewhere66: Nice, yall got this
Downbeat110: that way you can bubble them better
vulpesvs: Still a good push
deddzombie: yeah save your ult for when their healers ult you just be throwing it
Rrredc7: Yo des!
Downbeat110: also always prioritize bubbling teammates over yourself
pringle_fahad: @Downbeat110 facts especially healers or if a dps is ulting
eguzman54: des u teamed up Jay when u use ur F to clone and when u heal someone ur clone heals u to
vulpesvs: Use your F more des . It'll help when low
eguzman54: i meant bubble not heal
pringle_fahad: so u basically get 2 bubbles for the price of one.. fire
SnakesRDY: Des don't forget to use your team up ability
crtifiedboogyman: F des
shiningvega7: W magneto jus tcame here to say that
Downbeat110: des  i know everyone is harping on this but, you should use your f any time your in trouble
BlvckMidas: they doing so much damage to yall
Downbeat110: like you died twice without using it when it could have atleast prolonged your life there
dbrazierr: u dont usualy have an emma so not ur fault
Downbeat110: yea its something you gotta get used too
SistahSoldier: gg
Rrredc7: U good des, save your ult for enemy support ults tho
Downbeat110: yea you should try to keep your ult for sup ults anytime they play cloak luna or mantis
saak0708: tell jay pay attention to point more
crtifiedboogyman: that Wolverine was a problem
youwindiz: des can you cuss at me
hypiron: Use mags team up with emma
drewski_with_a_brewski: You'll get em next time broski 💪🏼💪🏼

Whyisallusernametaken: @eracoid Yeah, ts prerecorded
gbj1983: he can stun and shield himself and others, press backline, and leap away
eracoid: @imazhu u might be him
Downbeat110: des with ippi getting better on wanda, you should use strange more
nimbustoofaraway: top right on your profile
Downbeat110: the teamup wanda has is the strongest inthe game rn
EmperorOfChickens: btw use mag ult just to kill healer's out their ult or punisher when he ults
gbj1983: mag good too, just focus on aiming his ult
EmperorOfChickens: i notice u use ur ult to attack when hes more of a defensive ult
BlvckMidas: shit atleast yall got 2 comps now with mark on Emma, dyl can play psy
Whyisallusernametaken: w lore
BlvckMidas: just use the teamup
hypiron: The team up with  mag and Emma gives you double shields
gbj1983: teamup good too
EmperorOfChickens: dagger is the easiest to kill with ur ult because she stands still after she does a dash with it
Jefehuddy: yea pls practice hitting ur ult des
dbrazierr: look at mags distance
eracoid: MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL MaxLOL
EmperorOfChickens: u dont really need to know combos lol ppl just use mag to kill healers out their ults
hypiron: Yes but I wouldn't waste the ult on DPS
EmperorOfChickens: land ur autos get ur ult charge up
SnakesRDY: @EmperorOfChickens lets be real, combos aren't really a thing in this game. This ain't street fighter lol
Downbeat110: the only good thing about this combo is that he closes the distance with his ult
N7_Nobukai: yeah mag ult is for healer popping
hypiron: Use f and practice
Downbeat110: you can get right up on them before you throw it
EmperorOfChickens: @SnakesRDY depends on ur character like magik or emma frost
EmperorOfChickens: or pyslock
eracoid: Des you should do exclusive fifa streams those would be fun
radrob117: Des you should try The Thing. A combo with Leland's invisible woman and marks Groot walking people off could do some serious damage
EmperorOfChickens: also ur used to counter punisher but get the timing down when he ults cause he can break ur ult in like 3 seconds u just gotta charge it for like a second and throw it at him
EmperorOfChickens: ur ult is *
libanjamz: Des locked
Taco_bunny23: you can aim at the ground with Magneto too
EmperorOfChickens: yea des got it,
EmperorOfChickens: luna is the hardest to hit tho lol i even miss, cause u have to hit them directly
SnakesRDY: using magneto's ult with rocket's ult is good cause of the damage boost
EmperorOfChickens: i dont think their rocket is good at timing it like that
EmperorOfChickens: he should just focus on solo carrying with mag
xshinra7: des is you ever come across a cloak and dagger ulting, ult at the same time then throw it at her when she dashes third time and stops before her forth dash

EmperorOfChickens: oh this quick play? lol
EmperorOfChickens: yea it def is lol
princeofbieber: Des use your E more, pretty much anytime it's off cooldown u'll deal more damage
eracoid: the extended queue has to be due to the full stack as it pairs you with other full stacks
414_Curt: Dylan gotta stay off TikTok bigpuffSip bigpuffSip bigpuffSip bigpuffSip bigpuffSip bigpuffSideeye
BlvckMidas: are there really no 6 stacks of bronzes in the entire country on at all?
