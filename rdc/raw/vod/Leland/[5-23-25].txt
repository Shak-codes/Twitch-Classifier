SistahSoldier: lock in

kemukei: Nah lee your invis is decent just a lil more to polish

kemukei: Goated stall
kemukei: oh yea great plays
justreyfpv: is he gunna be the only one on controller in the rdc comp?
quanhitta420: good shiii
darrylthepeoplehelper: hot
HoodieAkame: im a store manager, i got a bunch of videos of me like catching theives and homeless people doing just weird shit like cooking a turkey on a basket,niggas blew up a propane tank once, that shit cool to post like would you watch if you came acrooss it type shi
kemukei: Fantastic pull
darrylthepeoplehelper: ULT
darrylthepeoplehelper: bull crap tbh. good ULT big bro
SistahSoldier: gg
tsunderefudgeboi69: Gg
darrylthepeoplehelper: you did go crazy bro.
kemukei: Went dummy just then
rubinho_5: gg NT
tsunderefudgeboi69: Lmao was that a stream sniper
eughtrag: SPIKE RUSH ROCKET LEAGUE
darrylthepeoplehelper: you have to also know when to pull some character into your team. people that are bad at close range pull them.
znonymous7: u good lee
eughtrag: 3 tanks and 3 healers you can bulldoze fr
darrylthepeoplehelper: not only push
AkiiFPSS: IGNORED FANTASTIC 4 SUPER
darrylthepeoplehelper: thanks bro.
znonymous7: bros name really checks out
bigfettioh: Lee be carrying
darrylthepeoplehelper: push
kemukei: great vortex
darrylthepeoplehelper: there you goooooo!!!!!
darrylthepeoplehelper: HEALER MVP FOR SURE. KEEP IT UP
kemukei: That thor is gonna keep trying that now fs
tsunderefudgeboi69: Ngl lee you got too close
bigfettioh: Gotta get behind cover
prestonatorXL: just cause u have ult don’t mean u got to use ur lee. save it more
kemukei: Invis' shield is actually insane
darrylthepeoplehelper: if they get close put your LB straight down on yourself so they have to back up.
lunbagoo: lee you can run luna snow and use your freeze to stop scarlet ult
darrylthepeoplehelper: spam ults. supp get them faster than everybody. 3 times a round vs 7 times a round.
prestonatorXL: please use ults defensively
bigfettioh: Invis is better than luna overall though
darrylthepeoplehelper: 3 times around vs 7 times.
darrylthepeoplehelper: 3 times vs 7 times???
BlackStorm20x: supports can get ults fast, but that doesn't mean use it ASAP
bishertgab: Yea spam it and we’ll see what happens and why that was a terrible recommendation
AkiiFPSS: DOONT SPAM NIGGA U A HEALER
kemukei: You can treat pocketing the shield like another reload, keeping it fresh makes for great plays
BlackStorm20x: that's terrible logic
bishertgab: STAY IN ur ult lee
AkiiFPSS: DONT SPAM UR A HEALER ULT I
Kumafye: stay in your own ult...
Jefehuddy: who is saying spam it no way right
SirTaeman: Lee don’t spam Wanda will one shot you
bishertgab: There’s some double agents in here
brotherhood_kicks: yea lee dnt spam your ult thats not good dnt listen to him
prestonatorXL: do not spam it only use it defensible
kemukei: Good shit right there
brotherhood_kicks: lee use your ult for counters
bishertgab: It’s hard to learn with this sorry chat I don’t blame him
Jefehuddy: @bishertgab nah fr lmaoo
bigfettioh: Spamming it works tbh he is at 80 right now
kemukei: Support ults are definitely best when REACTING
bigfettioh: It depends on sicircumstance
bishertgab: Look at how the guy who said it hasn’t said anything since btw
darrylthepeoplehelper: there your invisible jump. you can juke them. for example jump right first, then on the double jump, jump left.
BlackStorm20x: @bigfettioh yes, but he uses it as soon as he sees an opposing healer ult. That's not necessary
BlackStorm20x: thats also part of the reason we see double ults
BlackStorm20x: cause they both just drop their ults to "counter" a healing ult
kemukei: A well placed ult can neutralize offensive and even other support ults
BlackStorm20x: which isn't even necessary
bigfettioh: @BlackStorm20x It's all about sustain
Tagmannn: winnable
bishertgab: Good stuff Lee
bigfettioh: move up
Kumafye: other tream staggering hard asf
SistahSoldier: w
iiDMK: W
BlackStorm20x: @bigfettioh I understand, but you dont need to use it ASAP
bishertgab: NICE
BlackStorm20x: at least assess the situation first
bishertgab: Damn
darrylthepeoplehelper: MOST HEALS I BET.
SistahSoldier: dang
meerrkaat: probably need to save ult for strange
znonymous7: all g
kemukei: You're on job bru
tsunderefudgeboi69: I know they popping off rn
justreyfpv: when you die you can’t see if the person that killed yiu has ults yall gotta play off that
bigfettioh: Honestly people just gotta get more kills
bishertgab: Yea save it for strange
BlackStorm20x: while you can use ult every fight, WHEN you use the ult matters. Don't just drop it suddenly @RdcGamingThree
justreyfpv: you CAN SEE my bad
BlackStorm20x: And yes, the orb is how you can get ult fast
kemukei: orb go dummy for holding chokes
Kumafye: keep using your ult like you just did everytime
darrylthepeoplehelper: 17k healing is crazy!!!! rdcDiddylee rdcDiddylee
AkiiFPSS: DON'T SUPER AFTER FANTASTIC
scoobydooby0502: Lee actually be cooking
DaezdNK: ippi need soembody else
scoobydooby0502: I like your aggression as a healer, keep the pressure on
darrylthepeoplehelper: Jump one way Lee. then jump the other to disappear and they won’t find you
DaezdNK: ippi use human torch for thW
justreyfpv: yall gotta bait out there healer ults try to stay alive then push
darrylthepeoplehelper: pull them into the LB
BlackStorm20x: missed the ult, but that was good usage
darrylthepeoplehelper: good idea. tho
bishertgab: Start placing ur ult where you are more but good try
meerrkaat: right idea
bigfettioh: When you're invisible you heal so sometimes it's better to wait a bit before healing your teammate
THA_CONCLUSION: see how the OTHER team moves as a UNIT???!!?
justreyfpv: ippi gotta be flanking
BlackStorm20x: nice ult
justreyfpv: ippi need to flank and call out when everyone is looking at him
DaezdNK: yeah
darrylthepeoplehelper: there you go
bigfettioh: ippi selling lmao
darrylthepeoplehelper: pull all strangers
darrylthepeoplehelper: stranges
BlackStorm20x: Ippi lowkey better on Starlord if you ask me, despite the aiming issue
BlackStorm20x: g
BlackStorm20x: gg
DaezdNK: ippi should learn human torch
bigfettioh: He gotta learn fantastic they have problems lasting
BlackStorm20x: you were doing nice
THA_CONCLUSION: yall not movin as a unit...
BlackStorm20x: better than 2nd round
BlackStorm20x: good amount of heals
darrylthepeoplehelper: you def were.
DaezdNK: @bigfettioh facts
BlackStorm20x: Ben had the least deaths tho
darrylthepeoplehelper: 17 kills. 26k heals is great
bishertgab: Ipi again
DaezdNK: ben could hard counter strange and wanda ult with cloak
bishertgab: I mean Lee coulda died a bit less double the deaths as other one ain’t the best
kemukei: It's not "pick a man and guard him" you've gotta be able to bounce between people to pick off the other team
THA_CONCLUSION: yall fightin 6v4 cause niggas breakin formation
brotherhood_kicks: yall wasnt moving as a team fr and they had a counter for everyrthing yall was throwing yall gota learn more ppl to counter other ppl
justreyfpv: ippi needs to flank and get the enemy team to turn around and look sth him
tsunderefudgeboi69: Gotta die less so team isn't running out of heals you were too close most of the time
bigfettioh: Ippi hasn't had a big scarlet ult in a min
igodeep96: Ippi with 6 final hits sigh
bishertgab: RDC be stubborn lmao
darrylthepeoplehelper: use your ult quick but not immediately. the same life tho
scoobydooby0502: Lee need a lil bit of better positioning
kemukei: Peni buff is insane
bishertgab: Play more walls Lee
mikeoxblack123: Lee i thought u grounded?
bishertgab: U only 275 hp and healers are ez targets
scoobydooby0502: you too out in the open for them to knock you off
jepthepleb: does lee like playing luna?
BlackStorm20x: no
BlackStorm20x: that's why he on Invis
bigfettioh: Fantastic is easy as hell no way bro
jepthepleb: oh i see
bigfettioh: Moonknight is easy to kill, ippi will end up havng the most deaths
jepthepleb: luna is more of an mnk character
darrylthepeoplehelper: you got a good strat it’s gonna be good over time bro. trust
brotherhood_kicks: yall all need to learn at least 2 characters fr cause each character is a counter to a character so yall have more options
josephito15: Emma shield blocks heals like groot so be aware of that
kemukei: They're just poking down that lane
bigfettioh: warlock is greedy you can pull him in he's bad close
BlackStorm20x: good ult
BlackStorm20x: died to Hawkeye tho
maerceci09: Lee, please pitch the idea of Ipi being a healer and you playing with SM... You'll be able to get in and out on their back line...
scoobydooby0502: that’s why I’m talking about, you too in the open for them to pick you up
darrylthepeoplehelper: another great heal round Lee. WATCH
bigfettioh: Mark missed that ult so badly lmao
maerceci09: Lee, don't run in the middle of the battle... Stay around the edges...
kemukei: Yall lket them poke down that lane too long
lilpan13: Ippi was dying too much, he barely got kills
BoneBoneSlays: Leee call out who you are healing
josephito15: You should not be in the open. Find cover and stay in the back
darrylthepeoplehelper: it’s because your team is playing people they aren’t good with.
BlackStorm20x: just need to stay clear of hawkeye the best you can right now
darrylthepeoplehelper: you can’t just bring out a mf and expect to cook.
BlackStorm20x: waaaay too far up
lilpan13: Lee you need to stay back
BlackStorm20x: only 3 of yall, shoulda just backed out
bigfettioh: gotta use that shield more bro
kemukei: excellent prioritizing there
BlackStorm20x: you wont win a 3v6
kemukei: mark just hopped in tho lmao
darrylthepeoplehelper: LB down
BlackStorm20x: gg
lilpan13: Maybe they’re just tired tonight
darrylthepeoplehelper: good game again bro!!!!
ClowwDTR: Ippi!!!!
SistahSoldier: gg
spicykingyeahmann: you guess healing way better than them how?
kemukei: aye good games tho, I'm seeing the polish
Sayv0o: yall good big bro
darrylthepeoplehelper: heals plus kills
Sayv0o: shake it off🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️
Sayv0o: good players lose and don’t let it shake them
lilpan13: We need at least one win
sakugart: yall should practice on quick playu
ClowwDTR: Ippi might as well go hop in that hyperbolic time chamber
Kumafye: can you play rocket and ben plays invisible woman?
kctheace: hol on lee
Sayv0o: ippi gettin packed tf up😭
kemukei: Please get ippi in the HTC
quanhitta420: heals seem fine
augustharu_: Luna
BlackStorm20x: positioning perhaps
quanhitta420: yall need to focus there main dps
mikeoxblack123: ask for a trade lee
Sayv0o: playing your life
tsunderefudgeboi69: Stick to cover and die less
meerrkaat: deadass, telling Mark when he's overextending
BlackStorm20x: you're getting better with the ult usage
shayster911: it really aint u, its ippi underperforming heavily
lilpan13: stay behind your tanks
thegideon2410: hi lee
Skowed: TRY LOKI BRO
Jefehuddy: ult timing and playing your life
Sayv0o: you need to prioritize yourself a lot mroe
kemukei: keeping your shhield fresh
pharaoh_24: healing isn’t yall problem 😂
bigfettioh: Support is too vital gotta play like if you die then your team loses
brotherhood_kicks: yo positioning lee yall gota stay with a tank n pocket heal
micro_mini: TRY MANTIS
BlackStorm20x: yes, definitely use your shield more
kemukei: it's alot stronger than it seems
Sayv0o: you’re a healer when you die, the fight is lost damn near
augustharu_: Try loki maybe
lilpan13: Ippi at the bottom bruh ion know what he doing
igodeep96: lee you're doing good but sometimes you get too dps-mindset. just try chilling instead of jumping in.
darrylthepeoplehelper: you have to have a view of your whole team. go a l further back
meerrkaat: he doesn't know cause he's looking forward.
quanhitta420: like yall should’ve focused Hawkeye when u were attacking
Skowed: YOU ON LOKI WOULD GO CRAZY
gundampilot79: You need to place your bubble at choke point, but it's somebody's pointing in something point
Romeo_98S: communicate when your getting focused so they can help you and use your abilities
meerrkaat: and he can't look behind while he's fighting
paristonh1ll: i got leland added on marvels the only rdc who added me back the realest
kemukei: and your freezes with Luna are a little loose
bishertgab: I don’t get what Ipi is doing tbh
pharaoh_24: yall tanks gotta stop fighting tanks, because their feeding the other healers ults
Sayv0o: PLAY YOUR LIFE LEE
josephito15: Playing with the team, ult timing, and positioning
augustharu_: Loki is S tier healer
Sayv0o: you’re a good player
bishertgab: Low dmg high deaths low kills too
bishertgab: make no sense
augustharu_: harder thean invis tho
mikeoxblack123: If u improve on positioning, aiming, and game sense youll be better
brotherhood_kicks: but make sure your tanks dnt push to far ahead cause healers are squishy
rayshxwn_lnvd: tell ippi  to try torch
quanhitta420: yall and Ben just need to make sure u keep urselves alive as well as ur team
BlackStorm20x: yes, call out to Mark/Des if they are too far @RdcGamingThree
bigfettioh: Gotta take mental notes of who has ults and what their ult will do as well
bishertgab: @rayshxwn_lnvd he can’t aim bro
BlackStorm20x: or anyone really
kemukei: please don't recklessly follow your tanks
rayshxwn_lnvd: ippi needs to try torch
meerrkaat: And it's okay to prioritize your life even if it means that you leave someone to die. It feels bad, but it's better for the team
kemukei: this only so much survival you can output
Skowed: IPI SHOULD BE TANK AND MARK ON DPS
gundampilot79: You need to place your bubble that choke points and you can use your game scents to understand when you need to push or pull opponents
lilpan13: Definitely save ult to counter other ults that like Storm or psylocke
tsunderefudgeboi69: Deaths are thr most important stat, if you never die you are always active and helping the team
meerrkaat: You got this bro! You've already improved so much
LouieTiw_: you shouldn't turn around or look away just to heal your DPS, it's their job to be in your line of sight and or look for heals you should heal the tanks @RdcGamingThree
Kumafye: try a different healer lee
Skowed: Lee you good ngl
BlackStorm20x: @tsunderefudgeboi69 I think I agree with this. More deaths means less time on the field
bishertgab: Lee is good on Sue stop recommending other ppl
kemukei: Your invis is FANTASTIC lee
bishertgab: Compared to RDC Lee is not the problem he kinda was when he played Luna
quanhitta420: Lee good is just need to know what ults to counter
lilpan13: Lee if you see youre dying more than your dps or tanks definitely work on positioning
Kumafye: nothing wrong with learning different charaters lmao
bishertgab: He’s a much better Invis
JamJungle: Get ippi off starlord. He's too high skill of a character and requires aim
bigfettioh: Gotta use cover
JamJungle: He needs to play witch or squirrel girl
0neofakind1: @RdcGamingThree Could you ask mark how were you able to grow your head back to normal size
bishertgab: Sure but let him master one
bishertgab: He alr got a backup healer
kemukei: Torch AND Peni
Skowed: Why aren’t they breaking the bridge
lilpan13: Ippi always dying first lol
kemukei: Ippi needs to lock in on this torch
tsunderefudgeboi69: Less jumping lee you are basically putting your head up to get shot
gundampilot79: Invisible woman's projectiles ricochet, so a trick is when everyone's bunched up, aim at their feet so that it bounces through them twice
bigfettioh: Dont walk into that
brotherhood_kicks: STAY on your tanks leeeee
bigfettioh: its one shot
darrylthepeoplehelper: PULL TOO
kemukei: you've gotta get to whoever is at critical
BlackStorm20x: thank God, Ipi killed the Torch
Kumafye: ULT LEEEE
bigfettioh: ult
BlackStorm20x: ??????
lilpan13: noooooo
Kumafye: oh my
cruzcontrol369: bad ult save it
kemukei: Drop it for sure
bishertgab: Thank god you didn’t ult that
bigfettioh: dyl gotta kill torch
lilpan13: reset please
maerceci09: See Lee, if you were playing SM, this would be a great stage for you...
Kumafye: they are NOT leaving this room
BlackStorm20x: who is SM bro @maerceci09
maerceci09: Spider-Man
BlackStorm20x: oh yeeaaah
BlackStorm20x: yikers LMSO
lilpan13: Ippi needs to pin
BlackStorm20x: idk about that one brodie
BlackStorm20x: especially with SPidey about to get nerfed
BlackStorm20x: okaaaaay
tsunderefudgeboi69: Man can't wait for jeff nerf
kemukei: Ippi on something?
maerceci09: He's still good against healers...
darrylthepeoplehelper: 1 ULT PER round helps no one big bro
lilpan13: yeah this rivals stream ain’t getting uploaded to RDC live
darrylthepeoplehelper: could’ve got off 3 at least
lilpan13: Niceee
BlackStorm20x: @lilpan13 LMAO
darrylthepeoplehelper: HELLYEAH
darrylthepeoplehelper: rdcDiddylee rdcDiddylee rdcDiddylee
BlackStorm20x: heard it too late is crazy
darrylthepeoplehelper: THERE YOU FUCKIN GO
cruzcontrol369: you need to use your shield more
BlackStorm20x: we made it tho
BlackStorm20x: nice
lilpan13: Niceeeee
tsunderefudgeboi69: Yo where ben at???
maerceci09: Lee, this is a good spot to push ppl off the stage.
darrylthepeoplehelper: ULT
darrylthepeoplehelper: the point
lilpan13: Save ult for storm Big bro
bishertgab: no tf
bishertgab: ppl helper my ah
kemukei: You can expect a storm and torch combo
kemukei: really soon
BlackStorm20x: Leland, they were full health but Mark needed the heals
BlackStorm20x: oh shit
BlackStorm20x: team up ult
kemukei: She waited it out too..
bishertgab: That’s fine great trade off
darrylthepeoplehelper: GOOD PUSH
BlackStorm20x: ORB
BlackStorm20x: niiiice
lilpan13: njce
maerceci09: Nice push.!
darrylthepeoplehelper: get ready for ult
lilpan13: Wowwww
kemukei: You almost made it out
lilpan13: good push tbh
kemukei: But you exposed yourself again
BlackStorm20x: that was a good push
bigfettioh: gotta start pulling if they are on highground
bishertgab: Junped too early
BlackStorm20x: Sometimes you can PULL an enemy out of formation or if they've overextended
BlackStorm20x: or into your ult
gundampilot79: Invisible woman's projectiles ricochet, so a trick is when everyone's bunched up, aim at their feet so that it bounces through them twice. You need to place your bubble that choke points and you can use your game scents to understand when you need to push or pull opponents
bishertgab: Go in is and hide somewhere there or spread out more with team
darrylthepeoplehelper: great work. start pulling weak enemies for a good pick
maerceci09: Accidentally exposed yourself on that Jeff ult...
lilpan13: Rare ipi mvp
kemukei: You've gotta throw the shield first when it comes to heals
thegideon2410: Ippi is aggressive but he has bad positioning and horrible team awareness, he needs to be a backline DPS and support the backline if yall are getting dive and help the frontline when there's no dive. So Squirrel Girl and Punisher is actually perfect
kemukei: Less aim involved
justreyfpv: ping the enemy it makes the focus fire a lot easier then people die faster
gundampilot79: The ricochet only works when people are bunched up. You still gotta aim
lilpan13: nice Dylll
lilpan13: they too close to their spawn tbh
kemukei: FANTASTIC shield
spicykingyeahmann: Lee stay back man
BlackStorm20x: Mark lowkey may need to main Emma, he doing decent having only played her like 3 or 4 times
darrylthepeoplehelper: disappear
josephito15: leewe you gotta stay back
meerrkaat: that's rough. you got the right instinct, but you gotta let mark die there LOL
justreyfpv: ping the enemy team so people will actually know where the enemy is
kemukei: You can also pocket the shield
kemukei: bringing it back regens it's health
darrylthepeoplehelper: push wolv off the. disappear
lilpan13: Dang they never on point lol
kemukei: Ewwwww nasty web
bishertgab: Good
bishertgab: Lee they alr got point
bishertgab: it’s ight
bigfettioh: better off not ulting on check points
bishertgab: Better u didn’t lol
lilpan13: W out
lilpan13: W bubble
kemukei: two tanks
Jefehuddy: lee you are a good wolv counter whenever you see him grab just push him off
lilpan13: Niceeeee
lilpan13: Ben…
BlackStorm20x: where tf was the team
darrylthepeoplehelper: LB DOWN
bishertgab: Lee put ur shield by a close teammate sometimes so u can heal urself
kemukei: Niiiice shit right there
justreyfpv: if they don’t have a flyer mark could also play the Thing if he’s better with him
darrylthepeoplehelper: ON YOURSELF
maerceci09: Lee, you can't drive in like that...
lilpan13: Why is ippi changing so much
kemukei: You followed des into hell just then lmao
BlackStorm20x: back tf up Ipi, wtf
BlackStorm20x: what is he doing
darrylthepeoplehelper: see? wolv spammed 4 ults this round alone.
justreyfpv: @lilpan13 he can’t find anyone to get any value with
BlackStorm20x: this a gg, unfortunately
bishertgab: Ur walking on the mines lee
lilpan13: Dangggg
darrylthepeoplehelper: 2 ults this round big bro??
kemukei: Shield has no cooldown unless it breaks, you can mash the trigger to place it where you need
justreyfpv: punisher rocket combo still goes hard ippi should use it before they get rid of it with the next patch
lilpan13: Stream snipers L
gundampilot79: Don't spill them. You're double jump, you use it when you need to get out of a situation and retreat, because once you're invisible, it heals you away, you after six seconds
kemukei: Excellent healing
BlackStorm20x: @lilpan13 might be stream snipers, but they could have won that shit
kemukei: Outhealed both theirs
maerceci09: You did good overall.!
SistahSoldier: gg
brotherhood_kicks: they was splitting ya;; up fr yall gota stick together
BlackStorm20x: they were not healing, wtf
Jefehuddy: 14 deaths you gotta protect yourself big bro
justreyfpv: I was talking all that and he got svp
darrylthepeoplehelper: semi good heals bro.
justreyfpv: that’s my bad ippi
drewski_with_a_brewski: You'll get em next time broski 🙏🏼💪🏼
justreyfpv: that me
BlackStorm20x: Ipi getting SVP is crazy
maerceci09: Yeah, you gotta stay back because 14 deaths as a healer is not helping your team...
kemukei: Please stop following your tanks into deaht
lilpan13: Healers deadass can’t be having more deaths than the dps or tanks  tbh
justreyfpv: the thing got the team up with invisible woman
josephito15: @kemukei ^
BlackStorm20x: @RdcGamingThree you doing pretty well, but positioning and awareness are your main things to work on, I'd say
josephito15: stay back with ben
ClowwDTR: aye Lee why he capping about them highlights
lilpan13: When you can’t even say…. my name 🎵
kemukei: You can use the vortex to drop flyers
gundampilot79: He's learning 😌
kemukei: it's a little tricky and situational but it can alwqays come in handy
kemukei: They go ALL the way through THEN come back
micro_mini: LELAND AIM AT THE GROUND
kemukei: Look THROUGH people when shooting
kemukei: funny enough
gundampilot79: It takes some game sense but a fun thing you can do is push opponents off the map in the right situation
jajajakosha: w duo
maerceci09: Practice spamming your small shield because you tend to leave it one spot...
darrylthepeoplehelper: LB STARIGHT DOWN
micro_mini: near they feet
kemukei: the bounce and return are seperate hits
jajajakosha: why aim at the ground?
Jefehuddy: dont do that lee
kemukei: hitting the ground doubles up the damage
Jefehuddy: your aim with the heals is good rn fr
BlackStorm20x: by towards the feet
darrylthepeoplehelper: it’s like a shield for you
gundampilot79: It's because her projectiles ricochet, when you aim at the feet, it bounces off the ground and goes through them twice. It's effective, mostly when people are bunched up together that way, you don't have to aim for individual bodies
BlackStorm20x: yeah, no aiming FOR the ground, for the feet
kemukei: but doing that makes the fact the go through people useless
micro_mini: it hits faster
jajajakosha: oh yeah its like a boomerang it hits on the way back but you dont gotta aim down really more like mind where you are hitting
jordfran: you don’t have to hit the ground with invis it comes back to you regardless
jordfran: no idea what they’re on about
Jefehuddy: pls dont start doing that lee they are selling you
kemukei: You just want it to return as soon as possible
BlackStorm20x: I agree, I wouldn't do that personally
kemukei: thats the goal
BlackStorm20x: It doesn't seem much better anywayas
moneymatt824: that is faster ngl
jajajakosha: aim at the feet lol idk why thats a thing
meerrkaat: @jordfran seems like an optimization for single target healing. makes you shoot faster by reducing the total distance the orb has to travel
jajajakosha: you dont need to i dont think so
kemukei: it's just getting it to come back when they overlap with the target
chanlee001: Aiming at the feet does more dmg because of the bounce effect of the ground
kemukei: When getting dove
jajajakosha: @meerrkaat oh that makes snese
BlackStorm20x: when they dive you, that makes snese
Jefehuddy: yea using orb on your feet is good for dive
BlackStorm20x: not in general
darrylthepeoplehelper: when they push you they get hurt. it’s like double damage
Jefehuddy: not for heals or dmg tho
jordfran: I guess aiming at the ground could make sense if you’re tryna quickly heal one person
jordfran: quite situational
chanlee001: Ppl saying don't do that don't know what they talking about
lilpan13: I wish I’m Mr Fantastic
fraudlucci: when you ult thats a good time to shoot clones and turrets bc teammates dont need healing
Jefehuddy: @chanlee001 im lord invis that tech is useless 99% of the time
BlackStorm20x: Ooookay, you know damn well Lord does not mean anything, let's be serious
BlackStorm20x: what is your rank
jordfran: that bounce tech really is for rocket cuz his actually bounce
lordrennis: yea play qp
jordfran: hers boomerang
chanlee001: Lmao lord dont mean nothing
BlackStorm20x: your rank is more credible than a damn Lord
Bruh_Mari: you should help Des learn how to use Mag’s ult to counter healer ults
Jefehuddy: @BlackStorm20x nah you right lmaoo just saw des get lord mag tbf
BlackStorm20x: Des Lord mag? Gracious LMAO
