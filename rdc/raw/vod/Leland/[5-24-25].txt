xxg0dsp33dxx: dont let it happen
oXtinctShun: YES EMMA ULT IS CROWD CONTROL
miysx: Dylan low
Eindyne: Tell dylan to increase his volume
thehmmmm: for future reference if you pull wolverine mid-air it completely cancels his grab
xxg0dsp33dxx: good call out
Eindyne: Nice comm leland
xxg0dsp33dxx: yeah thor is a problem someone needs to watch and target him
xxg0dsp33dxx: nice
kemukei: you looked right at the mines lee
kemukei: thats a huge stack too
itsseasoms: Ulted a bit early
scarcityhustler: You gotta save ult for hela not penny
AkiiFPSS: don't use ult cuz of penni leland it not doing nothing
em_ace_uy: Lee never use ult for penni ult, Penni ult is so bad u dont need it
xxg0dsp33dxx: HE SNATCHED HIS ASS DAMN
AkiiFPSS: OKK
AkiiFPSS: that good though u learning still
MARVINSROOM_2: let mark know his ult can pull the enemy team out of their ults
xxg0dsp33dxx: i think you need an answer for divers like wolverine and thor thats a massive problem
scarcityhustler: Trust penny ult is ass just normal heal
weariestbread: u need to learn the lethal ults that u need to counter
xxg0dsp33dxx: thor was fucking yall up
TrinaLanay: lock in yall, predicts up in main
GiftedSlacker: Ippi did kill the cloak near the end there with his ult. Dont forget to give him his props
LordLassy: Leland I know the chat says a bunch of things that u think is useless but DEADASS if u play Loki the team would deadass go gold
bishertgab: Lee Mark got to help backline more
scarcityhustler: If you and ben get dived just heal eachother don't wait for dps or tanks to help to cause yall will be closer anyways
bishertgab: Let him know he can grab wolv, grab thor ext
LordLassy: he does splash damage/heals at the same time and he’s anti dive with runes (Loki)
dbrazierr: if they have a diver u guys just have to wait for the dive attempt before u get aggresive
ty_stillalive: CAN YOU TELL MARK USE SHIELD MORE
imelSomniac: yo what’s the word on MINECRAFT, I know some stuff big bro
dbrazierr: or at the very least healers need to constantly be healing each other when getting dove
ty_stillalive: HE SHOULD PLAY AROUND HIS SHIELD
xxg0dsp33dxx: 😭😭😭
BlvckMidas: but mark doesnt read advice or positivity lmao
imelSomniac: big bro did ya watch the marvel rivals updates?
xxg0dsp33dxx: nah mark we not like them
19butterman98: why did yall go the long way lmao
19butterman98: bruhhh
we_were_okkara: TELL IPPI TO GO LOKI FOR THE TEAM UP, ANTI DIVE, HEALING, and Ult stealing
bishertgab: im ngl Lee chat be sayin anythin sometimes
we_were_okkara: HE CAN EVEN BE USED AS A DPS
ty_stillalive: He does read but he doesn’t listen he’s good tho
bishertgab: Like look at the timing LMAOO
BlvckMidas: bro you are on drugs if you think ip can play loki
maerceci09: Lee, you can use force burst to help with minions like Loki clones, squids and mines.
xxg0dsp33dxx: bens right
bishertgab: @BlvckMidas u see aint that crazy, i said lee chat say anything and we got someone tellin the guy who cant aim to play Loki
ty_stillalive: no 1 person should at least help back line
oXtinctShun: yall run from divers and turn your back to em. you gotta back up and still try to fight them
xxg0dsp33dxx: you cant ask them to heal you like 2-3 times before they die whilst they get mauled by a thor
BlvckMidas: @bishertgab lmaoo im crying
em_ace_uy: When Thor dives you, use the PUSH first then JUMP so you dont waste the invisibility
bishertgab: Dylan should be stunning Thor
BlvckMidas: i said it 1000x times, if ipi goes rocket yall instantly win 50% more games i stg
giant_roach: If thor dive you then it's your tanks fault for even letting him back there
xxg0dsp33dxx: is it sponsered?
kemukei: Wayy early
marksheadphones: horrible ult again
we_were_okkara: TELL IPPI TO GO LOKI SO HE CAN RUN PICK AND ROLLS
kemukei: THREE? offensive ults just went off
Slygank: when you use the double jump try not to press any action buttons or you will break your invisibility and stop your self healing
oXtinctShun: ben needs to hide his ult more
darrylthepeoplehelper: when you get dove stat invisible a lil longer so you can escape
marksheadphones: @oxtinctshun fax someone gotta tell em
Slygank: also just use ult as reaction to damaging/team wipe ults. you'll waste less ults that way
maerceci09: They be destroying Rocket shih FAST.!
mydkiller: TELL DES TO USE HIS CLONE LEE
xxg0dsp33dxx: you guys letting thor get away with too much
em_ace_uy: Ippi need to go healer
kemukei: That would've been a good ult
opinabrian: thor been getting free eats in the back line
kemukei: He got his back QUICK tho
we_were_okkara: AND TO PUT IPPI ON LOKI
mydkiller: thank you lee
giant_roach: Mark not grabbing thor at all is why you keep getting killed by thor
Slygank: ya'll need more CC to counter the thor. he's getting ya'll for free because he's not getting slowed down/stunned
marksheadphones: we also said support ults need to be smarter
mexc_undefeated: I still got them mj tickets Lee if you want to go
darrylthepeoplehelper: if they don’t wanna pull back and save y’all. yall can jump Thor and kill him. you and Ben.
kemukei: Ya'll gotta bully this thor
oXtinctShun: ippi gotta start his tp and ult from top ropes more
oganomaly32: emma is the best character in the game at turning and helping when healers get dove. Mark should do that instead of trying to dive
imelSomniac: mark might have to switch to Emma, cause those buffs she got might def help
oXtinctShun: and he needs to stop telling des to bubble him at the start. he needs the bubble at the end
Slygank: thor is gonna run ya'll pockets again against this comp
darrylthepeoplehelper: just like that
marksheadphones: mark so ah
xxg0dsp33dxx: mark needs to use emma more like groot they are kinda similar
scoobydooby0502: Ippi gotta be Jeff hardy with his ult fr
marksheadphones: HEAL HELLA
xxg0dsp33dxx: with emma you could grab tanks and kick them away from their team and heals and single them out
Slygank: lowkey at this point just bum rush the point together and ignore the thor.
giant_roach: Tell Mark to stay next to healers so he can get used to grabbing dive with his diamond form, when getting dived
BlvckMidas: lee use your shield more plsss
GiftedSlacker: Lee dont forget that you heal yourself while invis
BlvckMidas: distribute the heals out
sdj4ou: When is the dreamcon match-up
TrinaLanay: W Censor Lee lol
Slygank: yeah that split up was a terrible decision lowkey
thedean16: Use shield
marksheadphones: your doing good tho Lee can’t lie
Slygank: i think an issue with ya'll is that you guys are a little too indecisive. gotta just choose a plan of attack and stick with it
xxg0dsp33dxx: it might be worth it to get des on an anti dive tank aswell
opinabrian: no comms
Slygank: you guys stayed at that corner the entire round
oganomaly32: you dont know enough to know what you’re doing wrong. Call coach
dragonxkura: LUL
antisprime: lmaooo
SistahSoldier: gg
marksheadphones: GET HIGHWAY
xxg0dsp33dxx: since des is fighting thor with magneto and he cant stop him from going back
we_were_okkara: IPPI ON LOKI!
antisprime: mark's crashing out the sponsor has their head in their hands rn
DayWithDenis: lee tell yo big cuz its ok to sell
salvador0647: deebee1Sonic
19butterman98: pls call coach pls lol
giant_roach: Melee in-between shooting to get more damage on dive + it knocks them back
19butterman98: tell dyl needs to call coach. Yall need direction for real lol
xxg0dsp33dxx: aye rage
Akyraryn: Hey Leland, Is there a world where someone goes Loki if the team doesnt know how to play against anti dive? Just an idea, because Loki makes it easy to save themself IDK just an idea
weariestbread: LEE YOU NEED TO TAKE HOLD OF THE TEAM, YOUR IN THE BACK LINE SO YOU HAVE THE BEST VIEW ON THE FIGHT, TRY AND COORDINATE THEM AND MARK PRIORITY TARGETS AND WHEN TO PUSH FORWARD OR FALL BACK
GiftedSlacker: Lee two things to remember is invis heals herself while shes invisible. And daggers heals are splash so if she is close she gets healed
YOitz_KO: marvel only sponsored to laugh at yall
xxg0dsp33dxx: 😭😭😭😭
oXtinctShun: plat????

xxg0dsp33dxx: Lee i think you gotta prioritise dmg less and be more of a heal bot sometimes. Monitor your teammates and see if they tryna run back to you for heals
0myre0: no way a rich person just told his audience “ y’all got $5” … RDC, Y’ALL GOT $5
