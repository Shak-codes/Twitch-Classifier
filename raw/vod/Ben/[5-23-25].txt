tarimaycry: you should consider trying loki
JovenB_23: Ben u would be a tuff spiderman
chopperfreaker: some of these mfs not even in marvel who is dat
xSokeezy: Ben you might gotta use a better healer
chopperfreaker: get out the paint big bro
LilHamsandwich03: no way niqqas be having a full squad waiting for rdc
xSokeezy: @LilHamsandwich03 yeah they be stream sniping
proxn_: you need to throw your shadow veil every life
SistahSoldier: yikes
chopperfreaker: shitty snippers
proxn_: throw your bubble at your feet and you kill Jeff
proxn_: health bubble, dagger dps in bubble
kingabe923: asalamu alakum to everyone here
proxn_: you’ll win 9/10 back line fights
sapenaro: Ben you should try loki. he’s a good healer & can do dps too. that way you don’t have to change between cloak and dagger. then Leland should try cloak and dagger
xenobest: damnnn
HoldTheJayo: already bruh
xSokeezy: @sapenaro loki is way harder to get good with though
NotZephyrus: hey Ben you should use Jeff since she’s getting a new buff with storm
simpward212: Might have to go quickplay so yall can try new characters safely
NotZephyrus: ITS GONNA GO CRAZY FR
simpward212: cuz yeah 1 groot ban and yall are hoed
Dat_LYNX: if yall want to learn new characters why are yall playing a mode where yall clearly care about your rank bruh
sapenaro: @xsokeezy you just have to hit your shots, plus it’s a blast radius so you just have to hit near the person or enemy
chopperfreaker: mark tweakin
xSokeezy: @sapenaro yeah but clone placement and totem  usage are way more crucial and harder to use well
JovenB_23: Ben so nonchalant
sapenaro: @xsokeezy I feel Ben would be able to master loki and all the abilities
tarimaycry: @xSokeezy its not that hard it just requires basic game sense
Dat_LYNX: respectfully unless he plays off stream, he would not
xSokeezy: @sapenaro it is possible for sure but he gotta stay on the same characters for dreamcon
SistahSoldier: @JovenB_23 be chillin fr
sapenaro: in instances where he’s changing to cloak, if he’d use loki he could damage and heal at the same time which would be more beneficial overall
SrBootywarrior: dang
xenobest: dam
theweisestben: good luck Ben
gigamunyun: LETS GOOO BEN
proxn_: save ult here
gigamunyun: BRICKNATION 3 STAR GENERAL HERE

jepthepleb: so close nt
SistahSoldier: gg
Dat_LYNX: nt
xenobest: damn i just realized the switch 2 releases in 2 weeks
theweisestben: nice try
yoruboj: Hey Ben a top player reviewed yall footage and said he could easily get you guys to diamond. Is it ok if i send you the footage and yall might be able to come up with a offstream strategy with him that yall don't show till dreamcon ?
xSokeezy: @xenobest that's crazy
Dat_LYNX: very solid healing to
SatoIn6: @yoruboj who
Dat_LYNX: yall solid on defense just need to work on yall attack side fr
JovenB_23: dyl was cooking
xenobest: @xSokeezy we about to see these boys on world!
theweisestben: @xenobest it’s crazy, I’m so excited for Mario Kart World
gigamunyun: good try ben u was healing !
LifeofRio: are u cooking ??
xSokeezy: @xenobest hell yeah even though world is looking pretty sorry so far
JovenB_23: Ben 1 lil thing is shooting ur gun when ur ult is up
andres_artist: you had good rezus
yoruboj: @SatoIn6 It was in twitch chat im going have to go grab it. He reviewed the last time yjry played
yoruboj: @yoruboj i mean twitter coms
theweisestben: @xsokeezy what was sorry about it? I’m not tryna start beef or anything I’m just curious
KingsGreed_: aye ben boy we high in here, i think des needa try emma
JovenB_23: ip was real deep
JovenB_23: pause
xSokeezy: @theweisestben It's all good. Basically the gameplay look really boring and too straight like if you watch gameplay the races are all hella straight with minimal things happening. But people have a theory that ninendo was hiding stuff from us so I hope that's true
SatoIn6: @yoruboj ah i see
theweisestben: @xsokeezy Those are valid points. I felt the same way watching the gameplay and was worried about the straight sections. Luckily players won’t be forced to race the intermission segments and can choose to do the classic three lap races. And yeah, I’m hoping there’ll be some things that we’ll get to discover that Nintendo hid from us
kikoforhokage: yooooo !
SistahSoldier: yall sending novels in here lol
proxn_: shoot healing bubbles at the walls so they bounce off for extra healing
proxn_: you shooting it at players and it’s going into the wind
xSokeezy: @theweisestben Yeah for sure
sapenaro: you can’t do anything right there , your coms were find but no one heard u I think , dps mainly
theweisestben: @xsokeezy We’ll have to see, I’ll remain hopeful for now, it’s been about 11 years lol
JovenB_23: good shit
xenobest: @theweisestben I don't know why they added so many characters that practically no one will play as. They got rid of Diddy Kong for freaking Cow, and it seems like all the characters are unlocked from the start, which ruins the joy of unlocking characters.
xenobest: game is purty tho
xSokeezy: @theweisestben lol yeah I hope the game is good because it's expensive as hell
theweisestben: @xenobest lmaooo yeah Diddy (and Funky) got hoe’d, hopefully they return either later in a free update or DLC. I think the cow is 100% a meme character, but nothing could prepare me for a dolphin, a fish, or a snowman lmaooo
tristinllzz: dont just heal,shoot that mf
theweisestben: I think some of the characters are unlocked through Kamek but even then it won’t take long at all
xenobest: @theweisestben Bruh I could care less if a freaking bee is in 20th place lol
SistahSoldier: dang
theweisestben: @xenobest nah facts, some of these characters are a stretch
proxn_: you don’t need to heal when your ult is up, you need to be shooting. It auto heals you and team
prestonatorXL: ben please don’t use ur ult if u alr killed 2+ on they team
sapenaro: practice loki when u have time Ben , you’ll be a monster when you master him
fym_3: Push
Kumafye: dyland selling ngl
sapenaro: that’s what good dps do
xenobest: @theweisestben I can applaud the developers for trying something new and innovative, but the gameplay just doesn't interest me like the previous games that came before. The tracks look really wide and uninspired, and it doesn't feel as fast as MK8.
theweisestben: Nice try Ben
lordrennis: yall be getting scared
lordrennis: take space
strech201: this why i said rl 😂
traviesomason: why i hop in stream to a 0-3
Dave34458: ben healing never go below 24k
hinata8008: W healer
lordrennis: TAKE SPACE
proxn_: It’s ippi
proxn_: he be dying playing 1v6
strech201: just hoop on rl
lordrennis: YALL BE STAGGERING AND WASTING ULTS
traviesomason: tell ippi to start a stream channel
ak_elite12: Ben stop using ults offensively
theweisestben: @xenobest yeah the gameplay especially on 150cc seemed slowed than usual, I’m hoping that it’ll be different when I’m actually playing it as opposed to watching it. It is unfortunate that the intermission sections are uninteresting, obviously there are some things players can interact with but I’m not sure if there enough to combat the boringness of the intermissions
ClowwDTR: bro get ippi off of dps before I call captain America to beat em
DaezdNK: Been do you save your team from Ults with Cloak shroud?
VixVoxFox: Ben try to ult more when the enemy team uses an ult that will kill a lot of people
DaezdNK: @ClowwDTR frfr like yesterday
proxn_: y’all target priority needs some work too,
ClowwDTR: Yall need to establish who needs to play what roles
444nabi: the shroud can be good but its never coordinated so it doesn’t save them
VixVoxFox: Tell Des to portal behind them so you guys don't have to fight long ranger on this push
ClowwDTR: The smartest ppl with higher sensitivity should be on healer. for instance Ben & Dylan should play healer
DaezdNK: can save against wanda ult strange ult iron man ult jeff ult magneto
ClowwDTR: ippi & Lee should play tank since they struggle to win fights so more health would help them contribute
ClowwDTR: mark & des play dps
ClowwDTR: Even tho the smart ppl should also be on dps
proxn_: y’all need to change roles
DaezdNK: i save cloak shroud for ults
ClowwDTR: but with this team Ben & Dylan literally have to play healer
444nabi: why did ippi use that in that room
VixVoxFox: Ippi throwing ngl lmfao
ClowwDTR: nd yall character choices aren’t lining up to counter the opponent team
ClowwDTR: BEN LOOK AT CHAT
ClowwDTR: PLEASE DUDE
ClowwDTR: GOD HELP THIS TEAM
444nabi: alright chill lol
proxn_: healers aren’t the problem
theweisestben: 😭😭
leishabelle: Emma is strong this season
444nabi: bro more stressed than them
ClowwDTR: Lmaoo
DaezdNK: lmao
ClowwDTR: I’m tryna see my dawgs win
proxn_: y’all been playing 5v6 for weeks lol
ClowwDTR: they gon get scraped at dreamcon
strech201: they not hooping
xenobest: @theweisestben I don't mind driving in a straight line and I'm glad that it's completely optional, but compared to previous games, the tracks, like I've said earlier,  look bland. I don't mind the realism and I welcome the change to the formula, but I feel like they should've added more "quirky" tracks like the ones in MK8.
DaezdNK: did it to themselves
444nabi: no cap💀
444nabi: wtf is that paragraph
elijahkyo: you guys should go against the Ai mode and see if you win against them
ClowwDTR: BEN IF YOU BOUNCE THE ORBS OFF THE GROUND TOWARDS THEM YOU HEAL THEM WAY FASTER
DaezdNK: @elijahkyo max level AI vs RDC
444nabi: wow
ClowwDTR: IPPI!!!!
DaezdNK: Ai wins 7 out of 10
theweisestben: @xenobest That’s fair. I’ll remain optimistic until I play the game, which is two weeks lol.
SistahSoldier: gg
strech201: rl
theweisestben: good try Ben!
proxn_: go to quick play or play Shamar ai real quick to practice
xenobest: @theweisestben yeh same
sakugart: yall should pracrtice on qp
leishabelle: Try Quickplay first
OrangeBellePepper: ben you wanna study loki? just to add one in your repertoire
comicbookyard: Ben I got you. Lord Cloak and daggger player
444nabi: mr fantastic ahh play
DaezdNK: Qp be worst sometimes
duckdogersdad: How many wins they got chat ?
jepthepleb: you dont like luna ben?
yoruboj: Ben get a coach off stream coach to come up with a strategy no one knows util day of Dreamcon
proxn_: go practice against ai
micro_mini: TRY INVISABLE WOMAN
ClowwDTR: u should have Lee play rocket
OrangeBellePepper: all good all good
ClowwDTR: bcs he more easier to use
comicbookyard: You can use cloak as an attacker for close healers and to finish off tanks when your team is healed
leishabelle: Positioning & Target priority
DaezdNK: frfr cloak be slaying
gigamunyun: in my eyes u healin good ben
duckdogersdad: Ben main Ultron when he come out
ClowwDTR: Ben or Dylan should play the main healer role if yall gon have lee on heals
DaezdNK: ima cloak and dagger lord/main
ClowwDTR: but Lee definitely need to hop on rocket raccoon
comicbookyard: Use dagger to knock flyers out of the air and finish off far away players on low blood
leishabelle: Have a dps player near supports for divers
sapenaro: I still suggest learning Loki, can heal and damage at the same time
proxn_: tanks needs to have the most awareness when diving it front lining
comicbookyard: Loki is a great back up healer too
ClowwDTR: if one of yall just say fucc it nd use squirrel girl yall a damn near streak up
proxn_: or*
DaezdNK: @ClowwDTR on gaude
444nabi: squirrel a cheat code fr
ClowwDTR: Nbs makes up for the lack of attentiveness nd damage
comicbookyard: practice with cloak use your blind too for your tanks to get more damage up front
proxn_: everyone been telling them to go squirrel for weeks
editiongenisis: Ben tell mark he’s a diver when he’s the thing get in get hits get out he’s not a damage eater like groot strange magneto
rayshxwn_lnvd: ippi needs to try torch
Sayv0o: Ben you need to play your life more mma
micro_mini: TRY DPS OR TANK
ClowwDTR: ippi needs to try the practice tamge
Sayv0o: you’re important to the team in fights
DaezdNK: RDC deeper in certain metas but lack certain fundamentals
ClowwDTR: range
DaezdNK: @rayshxwn_lnvd !!!!!
comicbookyard: You can be both attacker and healer. I put up 30 kills regularly with cloak and dagger
Sayv0o: ippi needs to learn to play with the team
Sayv0o: he’s a tunnel vision player
comicbookyard: @Sayv0o Agreed. This team doesn't favor those who go solo
rayshxwn_lnvd: torch is a good dps for close range and he can say close to his healers
DaezdNK: right click
Sayv0o: shoot whatever will get him in tune with the rest of the roster
comicbookyard: Use dagger to knock their flyers out the sky
DaezdNK: attak torch with dagger
comicbookyard: Throw your bubble down and hit the torch
leishabelle: Cloak flash the flyers so they get more damaged
DaezdNK: blinfd them bruh
comicbookyard: Ben you gotta take out the human torch with dagger or get under him with cloak.
ClowwDTR: BEN A GOOD TIP FOR C&D is to always be in position and lined up enough to hit at least 2-3 teammates with your E ability
JovenB_23: can you ask mark if he has hold to charge on with thing? it allows him to slam instantly to stop divers.
Sayv0o: gather the team, you’re the leader in my opinion mane
APthGreat: heal
comicbookyard: @Sayv0o Yeah, you got the best view so you gotta tell the team to listen to you and stop going it alone
Sayv0o: @comicbookyard bruh they needa relax😭

augustharu_: no
augustharu_: why
APthGreat: think you’d be a good Loki
thegideon2410: Hey Ben, there was video on healers and Rocket has the best healing output BUT ONLY IF YOU BOUNCE IT ON THE GROUND(OR ANY TYPE OF BOUNCE), IT DOUBLES THE HEALING OUPUT. also add the added healing change in Rocket's Ult, which is why Rocket is the best healer Meta
ClowwDTR: Jeff be getting gone on niggas
OrangeBellePepper: ben you're locked in you are amazing, you can actually do dps
sapenaro: don’t focus jeff when he ults
proxn_: why do yall continue to let ippi play dps
comicbookyard: Nice work giving comms Ben
thegideon2410: trust - aim it at the ground, and you have great escapability
augustharu_: @proxn_ lmaooo
DaezdNK: ippi on torch
yobazoba: @proxn_ Yall tell him to play everybody in the gae
ClowwDTR: turning your sensitivity to look up faster also helps with looking up to escape w rocket’s dash
DaezdNK: ipp playin like a tank
proxn_: told him to play one person … squirrel girl wtf u talking about
cyborgninjaonetrick: BEN I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE REASON YOUR HEALING ISNT SAVING ANYONE IS BECAUSE U HAVE TO HIT DIRECT HITS @rdcgamingfive
DaezdNK: somebody diff thats all
ClowwDTR: man I got 25hrs on spidey, lord squirrel girl, lord cloak, lord mantis sign me up for the team mane

stillpodzwz: I seen 3 of the same game and streamers y’all playing together??
SistahSoldier: gg
kisaki876: Ben for the love of god stop playing rocket on defense switch roles
cyborgninjaonetrick: I’ve been trying to tell Ben this lmao
streamingzeta: ben wyd lol
DaezdNK: gotta watch #1 Rocket Gameplay or something
ClowwDTR: Ben play Squirrel nd have someone else heal u be shredding on cloak & dagger lowkey
kisaki876: rocket is an offensive player I’m not trying to backseat gaming but cmon gang
schizoda: @kisaki876 huh?
ClowwDTR: them highlights ass
cyborgninjaonetrick: @rdcgamingfive with the direct hit change spamming heals is good if u get direct hits constantly. some of the vids u r watching are from the old patch, but bouncing orbs on feet does double heal
kisaki876: he should play rocket on attack and cd on defense
sapenaro: look up a loki guide big bro
schizoda: @sapenaro i think its too hard for him tbh
BlackBabyJesus9: BEN THINKING FR
DaezdNK: i think he wont use all of lokis kit
sapenaro: @schizoda I think loki would be the best character for his play style
kisaki876: Ben rockets kit is for attacking not defending
schizoda: @sapenaro he will neeed to learn positioning tho, and i think thats his problem in general
OrangeBellePepper: ben you take so much value damage when attacking, it kinda gets u in the zone too somehow
DaezdNK: jump
naturalnarcotics: Ben don’t think I forgot they hoed you from using Emma and now mark is learning her. lmaooo
schizoda: he should play on the roofs and dash away only if they dive him
DaezdNK: rocket all about positioning
VixVoxFox: Practice some of the Rocket movement on the walls as well. You can live really long by getting good at running away and using the float as well
DaezdNK: turn pvp on in practice settings
sapenaro: if he learns where to position clones & when to change with them , that’s the main thing.
Raightning: Also ben rockets movement is very nice. go high most of the times and remember you can heal while you float
naturalnarcotics: lmao Ben look so depressed on rocket, I would be too
schizoda: @RdcGamingFive your healing is good, no need to learn that, just try to survive and heal while running away
Min2mon: Ben you should check out sinatraa when you have some free time
Ralph_Lennon: lead your shots when at a distance
Ralph_Lennon: and moving teammates
Ralph_Lennon: yea you see it
Ralph_Lennon: when it's a tough battle i like to throw E when s
Ralph_Lennon: a tank is dying
VixVoxFox: Lowkey. You watch one match of a good rocket player/ Cloak and Dagger player then apply that to your gameplay. It can give you ideas on playing them better
Ralph_Lennon: so they rez
kiddrop3moff: Ben searching a video on rocket 😂
moneymatt824: he’s on console bro he’s still good but it’s still console
elijahkyo: YOU THE ACTUAL ONE TRYING TO WATCH VIDEOS ON CHARACTERS, RESPECT
sapenaro: @moneymatt824 they’re on pc ain’t it
kiddrop3moff: I see what people mean Ben chat chill asl
schizoda: NAAHHH celestial on console is different, no good black panther or spidey
schizoda: on ps5
Skowed: You or Lee should learn loki
meerrkaat: i see you studying my man, good stuff
chanelgoose: biggest thing about rocket is surviving, he's hard to kill. if you have good healing and low deaths you did your job 90% of the time
VixVoxFox: good shit Ben
18mukhtar: i just woke up and actually fell asleep from duck game earlier no joke
meerrkaat: watching the best players is a great way to learn
VixVoxFox: You guys also gotta get on top of the Ult voicelines. I feel like y'all don't be reacting to them
OrangeBellePepper: that rocket is moving moving
DaezdNK: a must with rocket
elijahkyo: U NEED TO GO ON DPS OR TANK SINCE U ACTUALLY WANNA LEARN CHARACTERS UNLIKE THEM
Skowed: play vs viewers atp lol it is for practice or just qp
fraudlucci: W film study
sapenaro: watch a pro , Tim don’t know he talking about lmao
JovenB_23: this is pre buff so ult usage is probably different
Skowed: Yea rocket can melt ppl he doesn’t just has to heal bot all game
schizoda: @JovenB_23 true
fraudlucci: his left click shreds tanks but bad vs squishies
schizoda: @schizoda and he has more up time on his dash and more distance
Skowed: Play practice vs ai and try new line ups
DaezdNK: i might play rocket now hol up
DaezdNK: frfr play against max level AI
naysayersss: ben studying fr
fraudlucci: hes also playing in a 3 healer comp so he can be more aggressive
JovenB_23: he’s walking down tanks only because there’s 3 healers
sapenaro: try loki quick match!
chanelgoose: thats dafran bro was pro in OW, hes cracked
dontSOAKdom: nah adam is cracked he just is a high floor and high ceiling to get good at
chanelgoose: hes hard to run from cuz he auto locks on to you
dontSOAKdom: gotta run away from melees when they hit they usually get buffs
DaezdNK: ippi needs to go tank wtf
sapenaro: sometimes quick play players are cracked lmao
OrangeBellePepper: cinema ben cinema
VixVoxFox: good shit Ben

nagsswrldfg: everytime anybody dives u call it out immediately
LauTheG: e
nagsswrldfg: namor counters iron fist btw to
chanelgoose: always sit near a wall so when they dive you, you can jet pack wall climb and run
JovenB_23: can you ask mark if he has hold to charge on with thing? it allows him to slam instantly to stop divers.
DaezdNK: rdc aint above Qucik match. their are sweats everywhere
DaezdNK: nice surviving
