Dpsmickey: Where's Ippi stream?
AJst0ne: that man is a pure wall, that pushback don’t do a lot
finddonepiece: just keep healing each other and fight back
MARVINSROOM_2: tell mark emmas ult is for countering others ults
SupremeWorthy: Ben what's your w/l ratio when it comes to fades?
qbenji03: Ben tell them that if des is practicing with mr fantastic then him and dyl can switch so dyl and mark can play tanks and mark can play Emma

rayy_keith: it saved time at least
simpward212: I saw the vision
alexandre_dagr8: not bad but prob coulda waited
rayy_keith: but now yall staggering bad
AJst0ne: I saw the vision but everyone pushed too far
finddonepiece: just regroup
simpward212: You coulda saved ip
caseohsdrugdealer: Cancel healer ults mainly
finddonepiece: Ben u tunnel visioning
rayy_keith: damn ben😭 u wanted to die lol
finddonepiece: your team is dying
simpward212: Might be rocket time
XxxNoz: why we lying in the title😭
snkrshead_: ben u not a dps
finddonepiece: it's not very good choice to dps on Dagger, you do almost no damage
simpward212: has lee ulted all round?
caseohsdrugdealer: Wolverine boxing
finddonepiece: @simpward212 yes
gffbdvdgsgvdvdg: they heard yall saying they wasn’t comp
gffbdvdgsgvdvdg: and then stomped yall out
rayy_keith: i mean realistically ipi is wolverine counter right now😭
finddonepiece: @rayy_keith yeah, that's crazy
simpward212: Lets get a dub without tree man
gffbdvdgsgvdvdg: ipi buns losing to wolv with the big witch
AJst0ne: nah yall pulled a Knicks right there
bushwhacker22: destroy that penni nest
gffbdvdgsgvdvdg: first time to lose up 9 with 30 seconds left
gffbdvdgsgvdvdg: 1-1282
finddonepiece: Ben u throwing your abilities aimlessly, use your bubble when your tanks are really low, or to heal yourself. So far you just spamming abilities
jestertalks123: fall back
simpward212: If you cant get a pick just switch back to dagger
simpward212: You was tickling them for like 8 seconds
jestertalks123: nice
simpward212: It did kinda look like a dropped item
finddonepiece: why u ulting Ben?
dilldoughdiddypants: Ben u should switch ur KO animation after this
AJst0ne: it’s storming in this bih
marksheadphones: bad ult again smh
finddonepiece: see now yall dying
simpward212: did they nerf cloak ult or something?
finddonepiece: stop using ult or nothing
bo_legged: going in a circle isn’t making proper use of yo ult
finddonepiece: @simpward212 they did but it's been like a long time ago
finddonepiece: Ben u gotta stop wasting ult
bushwhacker22: yall getting dove like a mf
finddonepiece: when yall need it yall dying
TrinaLanay: language!
simpward212: @finddonepiece Does it do more damage than it does heal or something
vSxolargaming: yall goin win nxt game
dilldoughdiddypants: Ben change ur KO animation
finddonepiece: @simpward212 it doesn't stack no more
dilldoughdiddypants: it’s looks tuff when u change it
marksheadphones: Ben your ults have always been bad
hinata8008: W healsssss
TrinaLanay: lock in yall, predicts up in main
finddonepiece: Ben u were SVP, but non of your ults were good, try to use your ult as a counter
hinata8008: chat 🙂
hinata8008: you're doing great Ben
WhisperSilk_: Yeah I dunno, I thought Ben's ult's were fine.
rayy_keith: only thing bad with ben is just positioning and tunnel vision
rayy_keith: other than that he doing great
WhisperSilk_: His positioning was good, he was swapping, using his E and everything.
oganomaly32: tell mark he has to turn around on emma when you get dovce
simpward212: his targeting on cloak too he was going for people getting healed
rayy_keith: @whispersilk_ he had one death where he went in front of the whole team and died alone on the point
LordLassy: one of yall should honestly learn Loki, he deadass the best for anti dive with runes and his heals does splash damage
we_were_okkara: TELL IP TO GO LOKI
simpward212: Mario kart world ad, on our souls we all playing that
LordLassy: loki would make yall go 10x’s better ngl
oganomaly32: tell mark he has to turn when you get dove! he doesn’t understand his job on that character. cant play her like groot
gffbdvdgsgvdvdg: tell ipi to hang up his controller
bo_legged: our???
WhisperSilk_: @rayy_keith Everyone gonna have a bad death occasionally.
simpward212: I thought they nerfed thor why he stepping on yall
marksheadphones: stop shooting
gffbdvdgsgvdvdg: @simpward212 they buns that’s  why
finddonepiece: no that's not gonna solve the issue Mark
simpward212: Nah bens right if nobody turns around ben and lee gotta help each other
finddonepiece: supports are the most important ppl on the team
bo_legged: bro basically said keep healing us as y’all die lol
finddonepiece: supports have to heal each other
finddonepiece: @bo_legged yeah lol
simpward212: Maybe you and lee should try pocketing DPS more
finddonepiece: @simpward212 i think dps should learn better positioning
finddonepiece: they always in unsaveable positions
marksheadphones: GREAT ULT BEN GOOD SHIT
WhisperSilk_: Already back to 50% is crazy.
simpward212: @finddonepiece True
bo_legged: Ben popping off
dilldoughdiddypants: that’s it dyl ur done
WhisperSilk_: Ben is good with the callouts on when to ease up, people gotta start trusting the calls.
simpward212: Idk about that ult tanks was dead
bishertgab: Yea put it on corners or high ground Ben it make it hard to shoot
finddonepiece: see if Lee didn't ult, yall wouldn't have lost the point
finddonepiece: you and Lee gotta stop spamming ults
bo_legged: nobody coordinating smh
finddonepiece: if Lee ulted later to counter hela, yall would've hold the point
mydkiller: TELL DES TO USE HIS CLONE BEN 10
finddonepiece: see yall have to use ult to counter them Ben
onwkip: Ben remember to heal yourself
finddonepiece: yall never have supports ults and yall loose cause of it
bo_legged: y’all tanks and dps have a bad habit of pushing fights by themselves
WhisperSilk_: I think making it about Lee and Ben's ult usage is just wrong. Like there are 4 other members of the team, it's no one person's fault or even two people's ult usage.
simpward212: Ben lemme see stats rq
dilldoughdiddypants: best way to use ur out Ben is when ur losing the fight
TrinaLanay: language lol
AJst0ne: rdcChated rdcChated rdcChated rdcChated
simpward212: Yeah, nah ben I was just thinking that I thought coach said to cycle ult more
dilldoughdiddypants: or when u feel like u are
finddonepiece: but Ben yall lost all the ights cause yall didn't have support ults
AJst0ne: don’t listen to them anyway half of them Plastic 3
dilldoughdiddypants: or u can use it to counter punisher ult
simpward212: A bad ult > holding ult all game tho
labyebmor: Ur sexy ass ben
dilldoughdiddypants: but Leland’s ult is better for punishers ult
Zaturatsu: Woah
finddonepiece: @simpward212 it's not holding it all game, it's barely even 10-20 sec
AJst0ne: is this stream sponsored?
TrinaLanay: ????
bo_legged: damn
Darionna: yes it is
jmoze80: Ben
WhisperSilk_: You're PC getting Throttled
baconmaster212: yes we hear you
Zaturatsu: It's a sponsored stream

Akyraryn: task manager, end process on marvel rivals, and reopen maybe
bishertgab: Right click on the game and hit close
ty_stillalive: YOU GUYS WHY DOES NO ONE EVER FLANK ?????
finddonepiece: @ty_stillalive tripping
simpward212: @ty_stillalive Before ben game crashed mark and dyl was flanking
ty_stillalive: YALL ALL JUST STAY BUNCHED UP AS A TEAM
ty_stillalive: BRO I DONT SEE NO ONE FLANK EVER MARK JUST RUNS OFF BY HIS SELF AND DIES it’s 6v1 Everytime with mark
simpward212: just load up gangbeasts
Zaturatsu: That desktop wallpaper is hard asl
Jefehuddy: ben when is your solo q arc?
finddonepiece: Mark can not flank
ty_stillalive: ipi should go healer Ben. should go tank mark should go DPS with DYL
finddonepiece: he dies in 3 secs
brayahdeloris: damn, benjamin ):
bombsie2007: BEN FINNA LEAK YALL
simpward212: @ty_stillalive Tank and support is too different tho I feel like
SistahSoldier: gg
simpward212: Ben got a support IQ idk if he can play tank
brayahdeloris: they neeeeed youuuu
Zaturatsu: Mark is crashing
Akyraryn: Is there a world where someone goes Loki if the team doesnt know how to play against anti dive? Just an idea, because Loki makes it easy to save themself IDK
brayahdeloris: you the glue fr
elijah92594: Ippi on tank
