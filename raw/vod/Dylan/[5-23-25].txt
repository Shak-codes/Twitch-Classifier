erictrump1: Go hella
jasonb3255: I know dyl thinking… “ I don’t care that I’m carrying I wanna win” 😂
simpward212: Let ippi try new shit
mikkshaee: You're going crazy dyl ngl
tarimaycry: if anything he should try johnny
mikkshaee: You're AIM is chef kiss
TM92_: squirrel girl too
AbhiSSB: ipi might as well play someone else
gravity07052000: bruh ippi not doing good at all
itachiuchiiha_: mr fantastic is good for anti dive too tbh
erictrump1: Hela
simpward212: dont cout ippi out tho last stream he went from 2 to 17 kills in a minute
redpanda_cc: are they stopping after 2 losses?
i9289eirui: des play venom
simpward212: @redpanda_cc That was the plan but they kept going
lbiggie420: @redpanda_cc  this alrdy game 3 or 4 gang 😭
Mactivish25: i feel like des really shold go back to strange with the current patch
DillPicklePiccolo: 0%?
AbhiSSB: @redpanda_cc its been 2 losses already
cruzcontrol369: flank healers dyl

SatoIn6: @nienny4739 what does that got to do with anything
Liamos9: this strange does not like u

redpanda_cc: go triple support
mikkshaee: squishy
Mactivish25: there are so many other issues  then dylans game sense
Liamos9: They targeted U so bad that game
erictrump1: Hela
i9289eirui: IPI SWITCH OFF SCARLETT
redpanda_cc: ipi isnt doing that well on dps
cruzcontrol369: Mr fantastic is the way
asimbiswal: team not locked today but you're playing well dyl
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: yall aren’t timing yall pushes right
zachary904: dylan fightin hard as hell for nothin
SatoIn6: @nienny4739 i think so yeah, they just lost 3 in a row now tooo
Jactonic: idk man gotta get lil ip off dps
4klupus: dyl tell ip to play tank or smth
alexblazeyt47: scarlett is not a good charactet
lbiggie420: lee almost had thr same amount of dmg as ip…..
ani_0620: not enough damage output
Cloud2iArt: Do your thing RDC, I'd just advise... If ippi plays Scarlet, Des should be Strange for a better team performance [Team up that kills tanks with Scarlet, and better Des Ults]. Otherwise, he needs to change to a more valuable DPS (maybe Squirrel Girl)
taytayseason: dyl distraught as hell
mikkshaee: not bronze again
creddoi: 19 kills
AbhiSSB: ippi should just play tank man
nienny4739: You may need 3 healers
redpanda_cc: ipi has been a weak link lately man
OZONEmf: on that map specific when attacking go on point from the side with like iron man because it forces them to turn around. u dont even need to do anything except contest point and not die
nienny4739: Adam warlock does high damage
simpward212: is mark groot really that essential chat?
psd070: ip 3 healers with u on hela
i9289eirui: dive character
lbiggie420: maybe ipp heal bot rocket and ben to dps…
Mactivish25: @Cloud2iArt ^^^^ thissssss
thehmmmm: ngl hela is a good one-trick. she can fry anyone in this game except shield tanks
redpanda_cc: 3 healers is the play
gravity07052000: ippi is the weakest link he gotta practice or something
DillPicklePiccolo: Dylan only dps cause you the only one that can hit the enemy team
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: it’s like yall aren’t timing your dives with what’s going on
jasonb3255: what’s the easiest role in the game?
cruzcontrol369: Mr fantastic is a tank and dps try it this round
erictrump1: storm dylan
hinata8008: LMAO omg
zaythovenzz: yall losing off ult usage
daniiii_phantom: LMAO
rayshxwn_lnvd: ippi need to play somebody different
sayzzzze: Ippi not a good dps
ani_0620: adam is good damage + heals
rayshxwn_lnvd: scarlet is not good
tristinllzz: need to
DillPicklePiccolo: go back to hela
hinata8008: Adam is clutch sometimes
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: squirrel girl might be solid
dzeery31: 3 healers really is the play, or ipi should change role with ben
Mactivish25: des dont feel like he got that same aggression on mag that he used to have on strange
alexblazeyt47: put ippi on healer
simpward212: @sayzzzze It might be too late but I always thought he could go back to rocket and put Ben on DPS
Codfan___: she already got buffed. she’s just getting a new team up
nienny4739: Adam the greatest healer make ippi be Adam
redpanda_cc: ipi cant play adam no way
OZONEmf: u would be good at adam i think so
Zeltrick: Storm dyl
zaythovenzz: focus healers more
erictrump1: Storm getting a buff
Codfan___: that’s a crazy thing to say lmao
isaacx6x: that is literally his job😭
micro_mini: dylan can you try fantastic
augustharu_: ....torch good too
ani_0620: im just saying ip on adam might be the solution
erictrump1: No
Dont_KO: let him use Mr fantastic
Mactivish25: ip on adam is a disaster
nienny4739: Yes ippi on Adam warlock
ani_0620: LMAOO
redpanda_cc: @ani_0620 we all know his aim is the worst out of all of them
maerceci09: I still don't understand why yall won't let Ipi be a healer and let Leland flank with SM...
cruzcontrol369: ippi on Spider-Man rn rn
Jactonic: lil ip on controller ?
ani_0620: the soul bond is so clutch tho
Codfan___: he should play mantis. can still damage and can be the extra amount of heals yall need
creddoi: oh damn they have hawkeye
Codfan___: or Adam warlock
isaacx6x: They have a Hawkeye
isaacx6x: GGs oproSmoke
nienny4739: @codfan___ mantis requires much better aim than Adam warlock
tarimaycry: @Codfan___ you need consistent headshots that wont work
Dont_KO: Hawkeye with mantis is crazy
simpward212: do they need more healing tho?
Dont_KO: is they really bronze
creddoi: They have one shot characters
AbhiSSB: yes
mikkshaee: so Dylans hero pool are psylocke, storm, hela, bucky, mantis, loki, namor, iron man, punisher, moon knight, he did try Captain America and fucks with it but never go back and tried it again
simpward212: They need picks
dzeery31: they not healing u...
Codfan___: @nienny4739 Adam warlock then because scarlet isn’t working
4klupus: @dont_ko that’s what I’m saying, making these games look like high elo
redpanda_cc: @mikkshaee when did he play mantis?
mikkshaee: where's the healer when u need em
augustharu_: this map is close tho
thehmmmm: adam warlock is awful without teamup. you're just -1 ult 90% of the time
augustharu_: like tight
creddoi: They have three characters that can kill your backline with one hits
Bentfreezy: @redpanda_cc Early on
kemukei: dyl their poking down that lane
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: psylocke
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: flank
kemukei: you've gotta dive
nienny4739: @codfan___ si Adam warlock the greatest
Guccivalachi: psy
Liamos9: Flank them with psylocke
dzeery31: stay hela ngl
kemukei: someone like Magik or your Psylocke
Mactivish25: go psy
simpward212: dyl positions himself behind or away from healers they cant see him
augustharu_: hela is good just diff him
augustharu_: or....
sushi817_: black panther is the only answer
isaacx6x: Psy will be better here
mikkshaee: @redpanda_cc idk actually, someone in the chat said it to me that he played it
4klupus: dyl u have to flank and use off angles on her
isaacx6x: just sneak
augustharu_: @sushi817_ LMAOOOO
Codfan___: @tarimaycry Adam warlock can work then. or just heal bot with c&d or rocket. he can’t be dps
nienny4739: @isaacx6x nah they have an Adam warlock and the thing
augustharu_: the tickle monster
khristhekiller: Hela is always good. you're getting picks
kemukei: You should've aimed for res earlier
augustharu_: nice
augustharu_: live
dzeery31: nt
ripnone: nt
augustharu_: there just try to live
tarimaycry: @Codfan___ i dont think c&d is good in general and loki would be better
augustharu_: dont 1v1
Dont_KO: res comp with one shot Hawkeye is crazy
augustharu_: nice
SatoIn6: @augustharu_ impossible there
Jactonic: w
redpanda_cc: good aim
simpward212: @tarimaycry whats wrong with cloak
augustharu_: @SatoIn6 nah he had 3 secs emma wont even looking at first
AbhiSSB: whre the heals
kemukei: EXCELLENT CALLS
Jactonic: ?
SatoIn6: @augustharu_ how would he get out of there
thehmmmm: cloak's fine. she's played in tourneys right now
Codfan___: @tarimaycry he definitely doesn’t have enough game sense for Loki.
creddoi: Hawkeye killing backline
isaacx6x: Ngl this is nowhere near your fault
Liamos9: Ipi needs to switch
khristhekiller: you did everything right there
grizzythebeastt: everyone selling but Dylan
augustharu_: @SatoIn6 up the stairs
isaacx6x: u got everyone
Guccivalachi: get ipi off dps rn
isaacx6x: its just the team
Dont_KO: Adam warlock has team up with Mantis
augustharu_: to his left
gravity07052000: ippi 2-5 just saying
redpanda_cc: we need ipi on a different role
cruzcontrol369: healers selling hard ash
SatoIn6: @augustharu_ and then go invisible?
krayzei: you killed everyone you called out
Codfan___: tell Ippi to go healer!
isaacx6x: U got every pick
creddoi: Hawkeye killed your healers
simpward212: Nah call a spade a spade 2-5 aint acceptable
Mactivish25: in all fairness idk where you would even put ippi
Dont_KO: mantis gets free revive
isaacx6x: u just didn't get help
nienny4739: Why does dyl have 3 less kills than the whole team combined
augustharu_: @SatoIn6 emma not gonna chase him
augustharu_: @augustharu_ theres no way
erictrump1: Pyslocke
dzeery31: stay hela big dyl, youre doing good
asimbiswal: I think everyone just playing ass today but you, it happens
ani_0620: does anybody know loki?
i9289eirui: focus hawkeye dyl
zachary904: ipi needs to stay wanda
SatoIn6: @augustharu_ why not, he has literally no way out
Tekstral: Im just here cus why not
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: try psylocke Hawkeye is taking everybody out fast
Jactonic: we need lil ip on rocket
SatoIn6: bird doesnt travel the entire map
blckhurricane: @nienny4739 Dyl is deadass Jokic carrying some bums right now, man
redpanda_cc: ???
AbhiSSB: ipi wasnt good on wanda either
SatoIn6: and iron man saw him
Dont_KO: Wanda is not a good character, he needs to go Mr fantastic
Guccivalachi: he cant go psy guys adam gonna soul bond
the434: ?
2xArceus: I think ippi should be squirrel girl or mr F idk, I know these games annoying asf
augustharu_: @SatoIn6 ong he did
Tekstral: !rank
Big_Swank00: y’all need a melee character (dps) I think lil Dyl
tarimaycry: @simpward212 she relies too much on skills for good heals when sue and luna have way better heals on normals + she gets killed in ult hella easily
SatoIn6: @augustharu_ hell no lol
channel23akimbodoom: Dyl you wilding
Rex_Sile_: yall need to take out hawkeye he does too much damage to leave alone
elijahkyo: you guys should go against the Ai mode and see if you win against them
Codfan___: Ip is just a cone out there and he doesn’t have to be
tarimaycry: and if you wanna kill and heal at the same time loki does that better
nienny4739: @blckhurricane all he really needs is game sense same goes for mark
thehmmmm: hela is a way better pick against hawkeye than dive dps are
Mactivish25: @Guccivalachi its a longer cooldown tho its not always gonna be up
channel23akimbodoom: “pinch” .... like bruh whatttttttt
sbsino: yappin
augustharu_: maybe not from way i saw he did maybe im bugging
sbsino: these guys are selling him

HooverForCougars: all yall playing bad, not just ippi

Jactonic: lol healers sleep?

Guccivalachi: tell ipi play squirrel girl at this point bro
lebartholomew: dyl locked
hinata8008: GG
Jactonic: Lmao
Dont_KO: DYL was on the flank he's not gonna have a heal with him
Codfan___: i forgot about squirrel girl. that could work too
sbsino: bronze
Mactivish25: @HooverForCougars id say all things considered ip is the catalyst and des is just a body hes not doing bad but he just isnt doin much
AbhiSSB: 4-7...
redpanda_cc: @simpward212 its the big fish
meerrkaat: The team is split up, that's the biggest issue
isaacx6x: Nobody is helping u Dyl, don't even trip
DillPicklePiccolo: yes
sbsino: no way
AbhiSSB: it is 4 in a row lmao
cruzcontrol369: MR FANTASTIC GA DAMMMMM

Bentfreezy: Watch highlight

SistahSoldier: gg
blahblah0069: nobody helpin Dyl
BwarriorOG: Dyl can  u have them just do Iron man Hulk and namor
Black_Renegade_: lol that games shutdown  who he playin wit
creddoi: You were doing good too in most of the game you played
AbhiSSB: dyl back hurting
AbhiSSB: i know it
redpanda_cc: maybe ipi go on controller, he might have better aim
Dont_KO: ask IPPI to try mr fantastic he'll live longer
BwarriorOG: just call it a day and watch character carry
augustharu_: lmaoo
Jactonic: lol
TM92_: lol
foo_rie: try learning magik
dzeery31: dyl youre CARRYING
Bentfreezy: Dyl been going super crazy ong
4klupus: what happened to coach
lordrennis: stop spamming ranked play qp and learn
Codfan___: this is just a bad rivals night i guess
BwarriorOG: ^^^^
nienny4739: You can always have 3 healers instead you don't need 2 attackers
Jactonic: pause
augustharu_: ...TORCH DYL TRY HIM
DillPicklePiccolo: Dylan need a back massage spa day after this
erictrump1: Storm buffs everybody
4klupus: yall need coach asap
augustharu_: hes soo good
BwarriorOG: BRO
meerrkaat: the front and backline are really FAR apart
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: try throwing your stun more in team fights
BwarriorOG: DYL
mikkshaee: yeah try torch, dyl
Guccivalachi: dyl tell ipi play squirrel girl he dont got to aim alot
Rex_Sile_: Ippi gotta practice
lordrennis: everybody should be trying new characters
Bentfreezy: Dyl don't need a coach cause he already a rdcDog
HooverForCougars: @Mactivish25 wrong but not far off, obv he's not mechanically there. But his game sense is higher than most of them. Mark plays to far up by himself and forgets the team, and dylan doesnt focus the right people. The healers are carrying rn
Rex_Sile_: @Guccivalachi true
thehmmmm: thing basically only has two playstyles: counter enemy melee dive or spam right click to farm ult charge with AOE punches. don't charge in.
lbiggie420: HOW LEELAND GOT MORE DMG THEN IP
nienny4739: Any attacker besides dyl have similar damage to the tanks you don't need 2 attackers
micro_mini: TRY MR FANTASTIC
lbiggie420: BE FRRRRRR
rayshxwn_lnvd: ippi needs to get off scarlet
mikkshaee: you're carrying for the past few games, it's time to try new characters
BwarriorOG: fk being wrong yall not tryna win?
Dont_KO: it's a balance you can make space but then he's gotta jump back
blckhurricane: @HooverForCougars Brother, Leland is not carrying anything as a healer. I assure you
AkiiFPSS: HE GETTING NERFED CUZZ HE BROKEN
nienny4739: Dyl you should try out Adam warlock
mikkshaee: WWWWWW
rayshxwn_lnvd: ippi needs to try torch
BwarriorOG: yall bronze cuz u and mark the only ones really on the program
AbhiSSB: if anyone carrying on the team its dyl
creddoi: The thing is a situational character because he is good at hitting the backline but he needs to also jump back and push back the tanks
Rex_Sile_: I mean thats how a team works
simpward212: @blckhurricane He atleast breaking even tho for sure
Dont_KO: let IPPI cook with Mr fantastic
Jactonic: put lil ip on ultron when he comes out
simpward212: ever since he went to sue
AkiiFPSS: USE IT TO TAP PEOPLE
Tekstral: Oi Oi Oi
Tellypooh: stack the mines and slam
thehmmmm: diving backline as thing is awful. you do no damage and you lose out on farming ult charge with big AOE right clicks.
augustharu_: hes good right
SatoIn6: i mean yeah hes OP
Codfan___: I think people aren’t doing the little things in their roles
lordrennis: is ippi trying fantastic ?
OZONEmf: torch is best dps rn
BwarriorOG: @creddoi Cap thing can be good to push like he thor if u got healers who down to push wit u and dive
thedripking92: no Dylan tanks go where the fight is if the fight is behind you turn around
Cloud2iArt: Either Ippi on Scarlet and Des on Strange, or my G needs to be a more situationally valuable DPS
DillPicklePiccolo: he looks like a better Ironman
augustharu_: I TOLD U
mikkshaee: it is
isaacx6x: WE TOLD U
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: make a box with your flames
hinata8008: yes bruh
BwarriorOG: u just gotta know how to use it
augustharu_: BEST DPS
BwarriorOG: im plat 3
mikkshaee: WE TOLD UUU
Tekstral: Even poca-san play betta😌
cruzcontrol369: try it
AkiiFPSS: HE BROKEN CURRENTLY
BwarriorOG: Soloq
gravity07052000: he’s getting nerfed next patch tho
TM92_: hes getting nerfed hard
mikkshaee: BEST FOR DPS
augustharu_: I VBEEN SAYING THIS
lordrennis: USE SOME NEW SHIT
Jactonic: yeah he’s crazy lil dyl
alexblazeyt47: use other abilities
Dont_KO: be about to get nerfed but yeah he's too 3
2xArceus: he’s meta rn
nienny4739: Ive never seen a good human torch he doesn't look hard is he really op
Dont_KO: top 3
ani_0620: yes especially with the invis woman team up
hinata8008: if ipi plays torch you play storm, they have a teamup
creddoi: @BwarriorOG dont know about with this team
Mactivish25: @HooverForCougars mark is also going through new characters but the thing he really needs is to learn how to take charge cuz your right hes doing his own thing dyls getting picks where he can but hes killed everybody and they still lost so the habit isnt gonna stick when hes kinda forced to kill everybody
moodment: yall gotta stop playing wanda ippi can get alot more value on any other character
erictrump1: storm
lbiggie420: NAH NAH ITS TOO LATE HE FINNA GET NERFED SOON
augustharu_: BUT...lee has to hold your hand
davepwr: dyl try iron fist out
angel_n49: Dyl ya should play more quick play matches before hopping in rank first
mikkshaee: WWWW
TM92_: your teamup will help when you cant get heals
Guccivalachi: he getting nerfed
redpanda_cc: is coach available, he should do some live coaching
BwarriorOG: @creddoi Right but we gotta stop putting false information on they plate they not good by themselves if they dont work tg this whole team just gon be shit
mikkshaee: NEW CHARACTER UNLOCK TO HIS ARSENAL
Jactonic: coach is sleep
gravity07052000: dyl be getting giga nerfed next update idt it’s worth it learning him rn tbh
creddoi: @BwarriorOG not false tho just because you dont agree with it
lordrennis: IPPI GO FANTASTIC
dzeery31: dont forget to use C when low on health
cruzcontrol369: wake coach ass up
AkiiFPSS: HE BROKEN CURRENTLY
erictrump1: Storm buffs everybody
redpanda_cc: yeah its not worth to learn him if he is getting nerfed
HooverForCougars: @Mactivish25 the answer to his problem is legit just thor, He can be as agro as he wants, and just escape with his dash and temp shields. its so easy best they're so stuck on their ego's that no one wants to switch up fr
ani_0620: your c is a shield btw
Eric19865: better to invest in iron man, hela, pun stocks
simpward212: @redpanda_cc Its been like 4 sessions without coach we need bro
lordrennis: LITERALLY 3 OUTTA FOUR
mikkshaee: @gravity07052000 what kind of nerf now
nienny4739: Tell ippi to be Adam warlock
augustharu_: combo the M1 and M2
HooverForCougars: no dis just saying
augustharu_: u gotta diff him
redpanda_cc: @simpward212 damn
Rex_Sile_: I dont think ippi should be on dps (no hate)
kazzy14_4: someone tell ippi to learn someone new Wanda is terrible and they losing anyway
BwarriorOG: it's false cuz higher ranks/pros/casuals use thing with a good healer and can prove it wrong just because theres an E that forces a teleport
mikkshaee: so who's getting buff on dylans hero pool
AbhiSSB: dyl call for heals
BwarriorOG: corners are The Things biggest friend
sushi817_: keep healing this man

HooverForCougars: @Mactivish25 He never tried him, thats the problem. I get not liking someone after a few reps yk. Thing rn is not as good as he thinks. Also ippi needs to get on a character that doesnt require as much mechanics/ aim
simpward212: supports kinda just heal bot / focus tanks
AbhiSSB: damn
23Sleezy: fire storm teamup is honestly stupid
Mactivish25: @HooverForCougars if i had a say for right now fixes id say they need to use the strange wanda team up since its kinda comfortable to them and the characters are in a good spot and ippi needs a 1on1 wit coach

dzeery31: shouldve stayed hela ngl
Guccivalachi: he went to 1v1 peni twice
Scehnt: use your c
isecronix: The more ppl in your ult the less dmg is does lil dyl
BwarriorOG: @23Sleezy let the spit drip out of his mouth
thegideon2410: A good peni and namor are diver's nightmare, since psyclocke damage potential is based on her shotgun like pellets, it lowers your ability to get close
hinata8008: damn GG
redpanda_cc: guess thats it
DillPicklePiccolo: 0-5 damn gt tho Dylan
Dont_KO: I think pay was a good swap after they got off fliers
mikkshaee: GG
nienny4739: Dyl your not that good with dive characters you can aim with psylocke but you don't use her how your supposed to
23Sleezy: @bwarriorog lol
fraudlucci: Dylan would lowkey be good on mantis
redpanda_cc: mark should be on groot tho
thegideon2410: Hey Dyl, if you coordinated a double dive with psylocke and ippi's Scarlet and destroy 1 or both healers, I can see yall winning most team fights. you'll force the enemy's peel and/or switch.
sushi817_: lockdown ?
Ron_2C: hate to see a good ipi game go away like dat
Skowed: FRM WAT I SEEN YOU AND LEE IS DECENT FR
SistahSoldier: gg
iTzNiKu4L: GG. U was hitting ur shots like crazy tho
creddoi: @RdcGamingFour You guys kept pushing them when they got their new spawn which made your team stagger
Codfan___: @ron_2c he’s barely hitting the back line. he 1v1s a tank everytime they pull up on him
erictrump1: Dylan storm
lbiggie420: my nigga ip is either elite or ass, no in between
BwarriorOG: You not doing bad brodie @RdcGamingFour just gotta stay locked fr
Skowed: You tried Hawkeye?
simpward212: @Skowed What needs to change
pringle_fahad: try a flier off stream like human torch high damage + good survivability
zachary904: ipi should stay wanda
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: it’s all good
sickule: @lbiggie420 no cap
Skowed: @simpward212 I’d say mark on DPS IPI on tank
nienny4739: Ippi should be Adam warlock
erictrump1: Storm dylan
redpanda_cc: if coach isnt available, they need another coach before dream con
simpward212: @pringle_fahad he did good as storm last stream
pringle_fahad: fly high though
fraudlucci: Dylan could be a carry on mantis shes basically dps
BwarriorOG: @pringle_fahad then ppl switch to Hela in comp
mikkshaee: It's aight, yll learn in mistakes, it's practice for dreamcon
sickule: ip on lockdown: complete ass. ip on rocket league: the goat
DillPicklePiccolo: you gotta stay high an camp door angles where they can’t hit you
Ron_2C: @codfan___ psy could kill a half health penny there. he only lost cuz mantis joined
colonelsandal: Crazy tho cuz y'all always got good stats most of the time so most of them losses probably come down on the little stuff
tristinllzz: that’s what shift is for
AkiiFPSS: MAKE A SQUARE
Skowed: OK DYL!
zachary904: @nienny4739 that requires aim
pringle_fahad: you gptta fly really highhhhhhhh
simpward212: @Skowed Whats a easy tank that ipi could play tho cuz I feel like tank is the hardest role
kazzy14_4: y’all need to start doing a 3v3 custom between yourselves to learn characters since u hate qp
thegideon2410: Tell mark, in diamond form, 2 melees and a diamond grab and kick towards a wall will kill squishies really fast - GM Emma Frost Main
pringle_fahad: fly higher big bro trust
Ron_2C: u prob peaked c3 buddy maybe not even that
BedBathAndBeyondBodyworks: make a square with your flame mines

Ron_2C: Dyl did fine
lbiggie420: WE GOOD YALL THIS IS PRACTICE, GET ALL THE MESS UPS OUT HERE INSTEAD OF GAME DAY!
dzeery31: use his ult too
simpward212: @pringle_fahad Nah cuz then your getting 0 heals
ILikeTheNameQ: dont fly too high with him
BwarriorOG: @Ron_2C ur prolly silver still
AkiiFPSS: MAKE BETTER TRAPS
BwarriorOG: actually whats ur account
BwarriorOG: lets check ts
erictrump1: Dylan your storm better
pringle_fahad: @simpward212 yea but thats the same as psylocke insta dying. also the higher u are less damage u can get hit with + u get over shield
ILikeTheNameQ: try the storm team up ultimate with him
ILikeTheNameQ: in practice
creddoi: You guys kept staggering because when the other team got the new spawn you guys pushing that with half your team and die
Skowed: @simpward212 Hulk fr you jump in punch, shield up then jump back to your team
augustharu_: use right click to make a box
isaacx6x: try the ult
augustharu_: no
AkiiFPSS: MEDIUM
BwarriorOG: No
DillPicklePiccolo: make a box lol
thegideon2410: no
redpanda_cc: no
Liamos9: no
mikkshaee: can he use torch during dday at dreamcon? the nerf is next month right?
Skowed: I would say IPI should learn iron fist but divers are getting nerfed soon
augustharu_: kinda is kinda not
VixVoxFox: You can be far away with Human Torch Dylan. You generally don't wanna be close
pringle_fahad: no
Liamos9: It's like storm
sameer40: nah torch is projectilw
AkiiFPSS: Q IS A TRAP SET UP
dp44l: dont forget to dive
VixVoxFox: It's a projectile
creddoi: Your right click does all your damage to be real
pringle_fahad: but even if you miss the fire still damages them
sameer40: just one trick the hela bro
simpward212: @pringle_fahad Ima have to dip out and watch a torch guide cuz I aint know he had a shiled
krazyondeadzone: Dyl go storm
Kerbie7: ggs dylan i was wolverine last game u had me a couple times on hela when i was spidey fun game @RdcGamingFour
jajajakosha: if you have a hotkey on the side of your mouse i usually like to put that as his ctrl or descend so you can constantly be moving
Skowed: What day is dreamcon?
augustharu_: Dyl mix in the right click when shooting the M1
krazyondeadzone: Storm gives the whole team a dmg boost
Min2mon: hitscan is if there's no delay between firing and damage registering
augustharu_: YESS
justreyfpv: use the E
BwarriorOG: I've seen people spam right then left and repeat and it do good but im not gonna say do that
AkiiFPSS: DYLAAN PUT A Q ON EACH CORNER

ani_0620: try the ult
tarimaycry: @simpward212 emma
thegideon2410: Dyl, with Torch you can stack those fire clusters and meteor smash and those clusters add damage for each one
mugiwarasaia: always remember your field can be made bigger than you'd expect
creddoi: Some people stack the right click in one spot and it melts tanks you shouldnt use it all the time tho
AkiiFPSS: A TRAP SET UP
pringle_fahad: youre basically zoning to give your tanks space and your healers space
jajajakosha: the closer you are the more harder it hit
justreyfpv: HOLD DOWN THE CHOKE POINTS WITH THAT
AkiiFPSS: HE PLAYS BEHIND THE TANKS
redpanda_cc: one day they will get a massive win streak into gold
pringle_fahad: @justreyfpv excatly
mugiwarasaia: you can make a box up 30m long 30m wide
augustharu_: OHH and only use the dive when your low or when you have someone low to finish off the kill
AkiiFPSS: JUST PLAY BEHIND UR TANKS DYLAN
fraudlucci: change descend to a better keybind if its awkward
pringle_fahad: @AkiiFPSS yep behind the tanks out of enemy sight
rrubinski: you can stack your right clicks then you can dive in to get kills, it does a massive amount of damage - it can kill people in one hit if you get them
sayzzzze: Isn't johnny getting nerfed
redpanda_cc: dang whats taking so long
cyborgninjaonetrick: @rdcgamingfour he’s getting nerfed in the dreamcon patch but if u still wanna play him that’s cool
justreyfpv: you also get shield when you dive so you can get away from people
23Sleezy: btw using your Q om your right clicks will do more explosive damage
thehmmmm: I've seen necros play enough torch to know 90% of this advice is wrong lol
BwarriorOG: U can do 4
mugiwarasaia: and slamming into your fire on the ground does extra
isaacx6x: u can do 4
DillPicklePiccolo: make a rectangle Dylan
pringle_fahad: exactly stay far and ur still doing work and surving
augustharu_: yes u can use that to make space for your team

mugiwarasaia: play closer inside your team too, healing torch is kinda hard sometimes
DillPicklePiccolo: make a box
pringle_fahad: @mugiwarasaia health packs around the map or leland can give him invisble woman sheild
augustharu_: u can fly faster by holding shift
mugiwarasaia: yuh
creddoi: I wouldnt play close with torch unless you are diving with your Q
pringle_fahad: dylan remind lee to give u the invis woman sheild
dzeery31: dyl, when theres divers use naymor, when theres flyers and long range targers use hela and when its for flanking use psylocke and when theres melee characters use flyers
em_ace_uy: His hitbox is hard to hit if u spam left and right because he leans
Ron_2C: nggas got Smurf accs
cyborgninjaonetrick: typically u go higher just to set up your flame walls cause ur guns a shotgun
CautionMaNiC: Dyl can you help mark practice grabbing ppl out their ults. Like wanda an spidey?
