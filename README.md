&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1. Introduction.** The following report aims to analyze the observable differences between individuals in different Twitch chats. Utilising message data from the five of: rdcgaming, rdcgamingtwo, rdcgamingthree, rdcgamingfour, and rdcgamingfive, we will commence with an exploratory data analysis(EDA). This EDA will explore the underlying relationships we wish to capture through sentiment analysis, followed by the identification of significant features, correlations, and preparing the dataset for modelling. Afterwards, we will develop several different models in order to predict the origin of concatenated chat messages and select the best performing model in terms of its performance on future data.
